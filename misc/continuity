A Guide To CalChart Continuity Files

    A good program to use for editing continuity is Write, which comes with
Windows (it's in the Accesories group).  When you save a file with Write,
make sure you set the file type to text file.  When you reload the file for
editing, Write will ask you if you want to convert the file.  Pick
"No Conversion."

    This is the basic format of these files, in the order of most useful
to least useful.  Each page must begin with the characters "%%" followed
on the same line by the text that is to appear for the stuntsheet's
page numbers.  So "%%1" or "%%3A" are good choices.

    After the "%%" symbol you can put just about whatever text you want.
However, there are a few features added to make things look a little nicer.
The most important of these are the tab stops.  There are three tab stops
set up to align to different columns: measure number, symbol, and continuity.
DON'T just use spaces to align these columns.  Use tabs to make sure that
the printed version looks right (and make sure you use a program that saves
tabs correctly, like Write).  It may not align correctly on the screen
(especially when using the special codes described below) but make sure there
is exactly one tab between each column.
    There are codes to print the special CalChart symbols.  These
can be inserted anywhere in the continuity for each page:
    \po plainman
    \pb backslashman
    \ps slashman
    \px xman
    \so solidman
    \sb solidbackslashman
    \ss solidslashman
    \sx solidxman

    There are also codes for italics and boldface.  You use one code to
turn it on, and one to turn it off.
    \bs start boldface
    \be end boldface
    \is start italics
    \ie end italics
Note: you can have bold and italics at the same time

    Finally, each line can begin with one or more of the characters, in order,
"<>~".  The "~" character is the most useful one.  It means to center this
line.  "<>" are for dealing with a master sheet of continuity at the start
of the poopsheet (pages with only continuity).  Since these haven't really
been used since the advent of CalPrint, you probably won't be using them,
but here they are anyway.  "<" means don't print this line on individual
stuntsheets.  ">" means don't print continuity on the master sheet.  Mainly
these would be useful for something like the spellout for pregame (something
that wouldn't fit on the individual stuntsheets).

    This should be easier when the new version of CalChart is done.  And
hopefully spring show printing will be finished this weekend.  Here's a
small sample to get you going.  Let me know if you have any question.
NOTE: the tabs have been replaced by the characters <TAB>

Here's the same thing without the <TAB>'s so it's a little more readable.
