   As some of you may have heard, I'm currently rewritting CalChart.  If 
you've never used CalChart before, go ahead and delete this.  But if you 
have any dislikes about the current version and want to offer 
suggestions, read on.  That said, here are some things that I'll 
definately implement:
   * Compatibility with our network (using C should take care of this)
   * Support Super VGA for better resolution and speed
   * Printing from within the program, including continuity (in Postscript, 
       based on the printing program I wrote last semester)
   * Animating a show from either alumni or student side.
   * Play automatically without clicking for every beat without 3-button 
       mouse.
   * Better editing of stuntsheets- deleting groups of stuntsheets, moving
       a stuntsheet, etc.
   * Renumbering stuntsheets that have identical points but different 
       labels.  Basically make the "hook" command easier.
   * Shows saved in a single file- save disk space as well.
   * Nice GUI interface
   * Easy portability to other platforms (not a big concern really, but a 
       good design helps and maybe someday someone will a Mac version?)

   And here are some other things I'll try to do:
   * Eliminate the use of animation files (I think this is probably 
       technically feasible, especially since we've moved the band's 
       computers up to 486's)
   * Improve the user interface, maybe select points and then change the 
       symbol, move them, etc. (moving single points will be the same) I 
       could really use suggestions here.
   * More commands, like GV, etc.

   Finally, some things already suggested that may not get done:
   * Play MIDI files along with the show (not feasible until the band 
       gets a sound card in the computers)
   * 3D view of the show (I don't think a 3D view of the dots will help- 
       you need real 3D objects to be useful.  Maybe export into a 3D
       rendering program?)
   * Desktop publishing features, such as drawing in the arrows, etc. 
       (Probably a little too ambitious, but who knows?)

   So if anyone has additional suggestions, e-mail them to me, or come 
talk to me.  At the moment, the program can load shows and print them, 
and the GUI is mostly done.  I'm beginning to draw the stuntsheets on the 
screen.  So it's not too late for suggestions.  When it gets to be 
somewhat useful, I'll put it in BRH so people can play with it if they want.

>    * Plus, a nice GUI interface

I assume that this means things like pull-down menus as opposed to
keyboard commands.  This is probably a good idea, especially since we are
basically out of letters for new features.  In fact, "hook" was given its
name because H was one of only 4 letters that hadn't been used yet.  We
wanted to call it "merge," but M was already taken.

Here is a word of warning.  It took a very long time to get the program
into the state it is in now.  Martin wrote the first version over a series
of months.  The second version was a result of Martin and I working
together almost every afternoon for a couple of hours for an entire
semester.  The point is that this is no small project.  I guess what I'm
trying to say is that if you think you may not have time to finish the
whole thing, it might be wise to just make piecewise improvements to the
current program.  Then, your work won't be wasted.

You could convert routines to C one at a time.  For example, the animation
compiler and the continuity parser/editor.  The problem with this is that
most of the historical difficulties will be left intact.  Well, you have
to decide whether it's worth it.

I agree that if you write it for X, you will be wasting your time.

Please let me know when you come to specific ideas about changes so that I
can give you my opinion of them.  I've tried to guess your ideas in these
letters, but I'd like to hear more of your thoughts.

The first thing you should do is call Martin Haye.  Last I heard he was
living in Woodland out near Sacramento.  I'd guess his number is in the
alumni database.  I haven't talked to him in a while, but he may be
interested in giving you a hand.  Certainly, he can give you a LOT of
technical advice.

A little background on him.  He was a junior transfer and was only in the
band for two years (89-90).  He played mello, which is how we became
friendly and how I got involved with CalChart.  I'm quite pleased that the
program continues to be "owned" by mellos.  He is a very nice guy, and I'm
sure that he will be glad to talk to you.

> Here are a few of the changes I'm planning on:

It would be nice to be able to use more than one machine at a time.

>    * Direct printing (including finishing the printing program I wrote)

This is something that we always meant to do, but at the time we wrote the
code, the laser printer was in the CRH computer room, so there was no point.

And access will be quicker, too.  Sometimes there is a fair delay while
the hard drive does its business.

>        concern, a good design will make even the DOS version easier)

It's just aesthetically pleasing to have an adaptable program.

>    * Elimination of animation files

How are you going to deal with this?  The reason for the animation files
is that it takes such a long time to calculate animation each time.  Thus,
as long as you don't make any changes, the data only has to be constructed
once.  The problem with this is of course disk space.  But responsible
ADMpoops always keep a clean directory....  :)

We spent a lot of time discussing whether this was worthwhile.  We thought
about inputting viewpoint by giving a seat number in the stadium. 
However, to make the perspective views really useful, you can't assume
that the bandsmen are points, or even vertical lines.  They would have to
be more or less human shaped (they could be boxes).  We realized that this
one feature would probably be nearly as complicated as the rest of the
program put together.  Since the usefulness to stunt seemed miniscule, we
decided to scrap the idea. 

East or west viewing would be a good idea.  It could be implemented very
easily even in the current version.  It's not a GREAT thing, but it is a
small improvement and it's easy to do.  there should be a flag carried in
the data for a show describing it as an alumni show or a student show, so
that the animation subroutine knows which direction is default for that show.

>    * Allow copying stuntsheets to a different place in the show

This can be done by renaming files and playing around with the SHOW.MAS
files, but it can't be done from within the program.  I agree that it
would be very useful.  It never got added for historical reasons. 
Originally, we meant the program to be a verification tool, not a tool for
ongoing creation.  We expected to have a paper copy of a show, and we
would just put all the data in.  In this situation, there was no need to
reorder stuntsheets at will.  Nowadays, it would be very useful.

>    * Allow renumbering a show without splitting it and using hook

We thought about this idea, but we finally decided that perhaps the
easiest way for the user to assign the correspondence for relabeling was
to create a duplicate stuntsheet with the new labels.  Thus, splitting and
hooking were essentially the solution we were looking for.  can you think
of a simpler way.  I would hate to have to type in 150 labels on the keyboard.

>    * Use VGA for better resolution

not much to be said about this idea.  we spent a LONG LONG time playing
with colors to see what looked the best for backgrounds, highlights,
labels, etc.  I'm telling you this because it may not be worth your time
trying out new color schemes since you will probably end up with the same
one we chose.

>        to select points, then change their symbol, move them, do a genius 
>        move, etc.)

I could talk about this forever.  Of course, this is the most essential
part of the whole program.  Our interface is probably not ideal because it
developed over time.  We kept making improvements to what we already had,
but we never really started over from scratch.  I'm not so sure that
selecting points and THEN selecting an operation would be good. 
Generally, a user does a whole bunch of similar tasks, then he does a
whole bunch of a different kind of similar tasks, etc.  It would be a
REALLY big pain if I was setting points by hand, and every time I selected
a point, I had to tell the program that I now wanted to move it.  Much
better to tell the program that I am about to make a whole bunch
of moves now.

Maybe you could combine the two aspects by allowing a user to "lock" in a
particular operation.  This operation would be applied to every selected
point until the user unlocks the setting.

This is the ONE idea you should keep in mind when designing the interface.
Over 75% of the use of CalChart comes in moving points and getting the
animation to work properly.  Your interface should be designed to make
these tasks as easy as possible, even if it makes other things slightly
illogical or more cumbersome.

Selecting points (we called it "blocking") was a major concern for us.  Of
course, rectangular blocking is the most useful, but diagonal blocking is
also quite useful.  Ideally, there should be three ways of selecting
points.  1: click on an individual point; 2: click-and-drag a rectangular
region; 3: click-and-drag the perimeter of the region you want ("lasso").

>    * Add more commands, like GV, SHNSEW (FMSH NS/EW)

Continuity commands are fairly easy to add to the current version. 
Basically, all you have to do is describe the movement in terms of
commands that already exist. Even if you don't actually complete this
project, these commands should be added to the program.

Rather than add a command called SHNSEW, I suggest that you change
FOUNTAIN to take a <stepsize> variable.  If someone wanted a show high
NSEW, he could just use fountain.  Otherwise, you'll need to create a
JSNSEW, etc.  This would follow the general protocol for continuity
commands.  This protocol is that there are essentially two kinds of
commands.  The first kind is generally very cumbersome to use, but it is
also very flexible.  The second kind is just a very useful specific case
of a command of the first kind.  For example, NSEW (second kind) is a
special case of FOUNTAIN (first kind).  FMTO (second kind) is a special
case of MARCH (first kind). 

>    * Maybe add drawing tools for the printed copy? (arrows and the like)

We thought this would be useful, but we never got around to it because
there were always more important things to do.

I've got to run right now, but I'll be back soon with more comments.

I have a couple of coments and suggestions:
	1) You wanted to be able to animate the flow w/o having to press 
the buttons.  I think it's a great idea but i think that you should still 
be able to use the buttons to move the flow beat by beat.

	2) I don't know how difficult this would be for you but since you 
wanted to be able to animate the same show from either the alumni or 
student side, you could change the demension of how the step sizes work 
in order to get a better feel for what it would look like from an angle.  
North/south is fine but the east/west dimensions are compressed from the 
angle of the press and student sides.  Maybee if you have the dots 
marching 2 by 4 rectangles instead or marching in 2 by 2 squares like how 
the old calchart does it now.  Maybee charters will be able to get a 
better feel for how flows will look like at an angle if you do this.

	3) I may be just going off on this.  But if you can do that maybe 
you could also change the dimensions of the east west spacing.  From the 
angle of the press box the east west spacing is larger closer to the 
sidelines, and virtually vanishes as you move further away.  I don't now 
how much work it would take, but it would give us a better feel for how 
things will look.

I don't know if I got what I wanted to suggest to you conveyed to you 
right, so if you have any questions email me back.

I would think that keeping stunt sheets as separate files has its
advantages.  Mainly, if things go wrong or you accidentally delete
a sheet or something else, most network programs will keep around
your deleted files, so you can recreate whatever you deleted.  When
you just modify a big file it becomes much easier to simply corrupt
the file, and restoring a small change becomes nasty.

Which will not happen until we move to a different OS (like OS/2
or maybe Win95 [or 96 or...]) since running a sound card AND network
software is practically impossible...

Nothing to comment on here really.  I'm not really a programmer, so I
don't know about all the "internal" stuff.  However, it sounds like these
underpinnings will make the program much more flexible.

OK, I think you misunderstood me the other time.  In order to define a
renumbering of any sort (letter to number or whatever), a one-to-one
correspondence must be created between the old labels and the new labels. 
For example, A1 goes to T3, A2 goes to 144, A3 goes to YOUR_MOM, etc.

The question I am considering is how the user defines this correspondence.
One possible method: all the old labels are listed on the screen in
columns, and the user types in a new label next to each old label.  This
is perhaps the most obvious and primitive method, but it is a HUGE pain in
the ass for the user.

There is a much better method: the user creates two stuntsheets such that
the set of locations on each are identical.  Then the correspondence is
naturally defined by identity of location (this is the method used by the
current CalChart).

I think we both agree that a "graphical" method such as the second one is
preferable to a "text" method.  Now the question is to pin down the
details so that the whole process is internal and doesn't require file
manipulation and such.

Here is my suggestion.  In order to renumber, two stuntsheets must exist
back-to-back such that the set of locations is the same on each.  The only
difference can be in the labels.  Then the relabeling command will merge
these two sheets into one and will relabel all sheets that occur AFTER
these two OR will relabel all sheets that occur BEFORE these two (the
user's option for BEFORE or AFTER).

One important thing about this is that there has to be an error-checking
routine to make sure that the correspondence is well-defined.  It is
possible that two points could share the same location, in which case the
relabeling command should return an error message and NOT execute.

While we're on the subject of relabeling, what about processes for
changing the labels for an entire show (instead of merely reordering the
current ones)?  Allowing the set of labels to change in the midst of a
show will wreak havoc with the animation since destinations will not be
clear is the labels are different. 

I suggest making two routines for this situation.  The first is a "start
from scratch" routine; it calls the same routine that is used when first
creating a show.  The assignment of labels to points would be arbitrary,
just as it is when first creating a show.

The second is a "point by point" routine.  Select a point (or set of
points), and then type the new label.  The label will be changed on all
stuntsheets simultaneously.

If someone really wants to have a series of stuntsheets on which the
labels change, then different shows should be created for each set of labels.

Now what about changing the number of points?  For deleting points, just
type in the labels, and they're erased from all sheets.  As for adding
points, again type in the labels (check to be sure that the labels don't
already exist), and they appear in the southwest corner just off the grid.

How do these new features sound to you?  Can you think of any other useful
processes?

Maybe geniusmove should be split into several commands that are more
intuitive.  The operations allowable by geniusmove are precisely the
"affine transformations" of the plane (Ax + b, where A = 2x2 matrix, x and
b are column vectors).  Mathematically speaking, any affine transformation
is the product of rotations, reflections, shears, and translations (a
shear is like a box becoming a parallelogram, where everybody marches NS
to position).  

Practically speaking, geniusmove is almost never used for anything but 
rotations, reflections, shears, and shears composed with a translation.
Of course, the last two are really the same since a shear = a shear
composed with the zero translation.

It might be a good idea to make separate commands for these three
actions.  Right now geniusmove is too abstract for most users.  However,
if more specific (but less powerful) commands were built, it would be much
easier for them.  As long as the ORIGINAL geniusmove is preserved also,
there is no loss of functionality.  This whole situation is analogous to
the relationship between FOUNTAIN and NSEW.

How would the user define such actions?  A reflection is determined by a
line, and a line is determined by two distinct points.  Hence a reflection
could be defined by the user selecting two points along that line. 

A rotation is determined by a center and an angle, so a rotation could be
defined by the user selecting the center of rotation, and then moving a
single point to determine the angle.

A shear composed with translation is a little harder to deal with.  Let me
think about this one for a while, and I'll get back to you on it.

All of these definitions should be "preserved" until overridden by a new
defintion.  This way, the user can apply the same action to several sets
of points in succession without having to redefine.  This is the way that
geniusmove (and blockmove) currently work.

Once you decide on a specific format, I'll be happy to do the mathematics
for you.

Speaking from the experience of spending hours and hours in the computer
room inputting data, I am firmly of the opinion that all types of moves
should be as easy and quick as possible, even if it means that other tasks
are harder.

Here's an idea that I'm not convinced is best, but it's worth
thinking about.  The user selects between two major modes - move mode and
"everything else" mode.  Move mode works similarly to move mode currently
does.  The action on selected points is implicitly defined.

In everything else mode, selecting a set of points doesn't cause any
action.  The user has to choose an action from the list of all possible
routines (INCLUDING movement).


>    I think that's about it for now.

Please let me know what you think about all of these ideas.  The best way
to come to the ideal solution is to bounce notions off someone else to see
what they think.

The situation may be a little difficult for you politically, but you
should really try to work with Stunt and Erin on this project.  They might
have some good ideas, too.  Actually, to be perfectly honest, I have found
that fairly few people (stunt members included) have had good ideas for
the program, except for Martin Haye and myself.  The only exception that I
can think of right now is that Michelle Sintov suggested that we install
Kill.  Most people don't think of Calchart as a dynamic object - they
consider it a fixed tool, and they are forced to work under the conditions
imposed by it.  In my opinion, this mentality in conjunction with a
greater and greater dependence on Calchart has caused an increasing
"mathematization" of our charting.  This is not necessarily a bad thing,
just a change.

i guess i already talked to you about this, but the only thing i would
really like is to be able to print things a lot easier.  like, just
say "print" and answer a few questions, which stuntsheets, the 
continuity, etc.  that way anyone could print something.

i'm also glad you are fixing the hook command.  we are definitely
going to need this for spring show charting.. there's gotto be an
easier way!

Yes, of course you are right.  I hadn't thought about this carefully enough.

Well, there are several ways to generate the set of affine
transformations.  I don't remember offhand which "special" transformations
generate which others.  When the actual implementation occurs, I'll do the
rigorous mathematics.  You are definitely right in the sense that
dilations should be added to the list of special commands.  A dilation is
a diagonalizable transformation with no negative eigenvalues, while a
scale is an arbitrary diagonalizable transformation.

For example, a dilation would apply when a twostep block becomes a
fourstep block.

All 2dimensional scales are either dilations; dilations
composed with a reflection; or dilations composed with a 180deg rotation.

Something else that occurred to me last night.  Block move is also just a
special case of geniusmove, albeit very very useful.  So, the working list
of "special transformations" is now: reflection, rotation, shear,
dilation, and translation.

Note that further restrictions should probably be made for these cases. 
For example, reflection lines should only be N-S, E-W, NW-SE, or NE-SW. 
And the same requirement should be placed on the "invariant" lines of shears.

This is the number one reason that I always said to stunt, "I can do
anything in half the time it would take you."  And it was generally true.

I like the sound of this.  By "button," I assume you mean an icon on the
screen.  Click the icon and get that mode.  Maybe lasso and rectangular
modes should not be separate.  How about right and left mouse buttons?

Smartmove was always a special case, even in the earliest versions of the
program.

OK.  Here is a complete idea for move mode.  My mental picture looks
something like those Macintosh drawing programs with icons on the left
side of the screen.  I'm not sure if this will fit in with the other
elements of your GUI, so let me know.  Click with the left button to move
a single point.  Click with the right button to smartmove.  Drag with the
left button for rectangular selection.  Drag with the right button for
lasso selection.  After selection, click (with either button) on one of a
series of icons along the edge of the screen: rotation, translation,
geniusmove, etc. 

But this presents the problem of how to define the "special" actions, like
reflection.  How does communicate the fact that the next two clicks will
represent points on the reflection line?  Perhaps click on the DEFINITION
icon, and then click on reflection.  Then the definition of the reflection
would remain intact until the next definition of reflection.  Hmm.  This
seems rather cumbersome.

For "everything else" mode, the set of icons would change to a different set:
label, continuity, etc.

What about reference points?  This provides a special display problem.

I don't know what to say to you about the 3D viewing, except maybe "good
luck."  I guess it would be quite useful.

Thanks for letting me have some input.  I'm really quite interested in
this project, but I don't want to muscle in on something where I'm not
really welcome.  To perfectly honest, I have way more "logged hours" with
CalChart than anyone else, including Martin Haye.  In fact, even when he
was still around, we realized that I was a better "user" than him. 
Anyway, as un-humble as this sounds, what this means is that my opinion is
probably pretty valuable.

I think that your Idea #2 would be of much more use to the cal band right 
now than the 3d rendered one.  I think if we had the sense of how tilted 
the field was from the view at the press box or even the top of the 
student section, some flows that were too small to see wouldn't have to 
be there.  I also think if you offer this 3D version of it chartig would 
be more dependent on the computer.  Soon charting would lack the creative 
originality that charting in your mind and then on paper would do.  I 
think there should be a little room for the mind to imagine.

My thoughts,

I guess this term would apply, but I'm not so sure that it is very
descriptive for dilating along a diagonal.  Perhaps "adjust spacing."

Yes, but the original geniusmove will be able to do these other things.  I
think the best system would be to figure out exactly what is MOST commonly
used and make special commands out of just those few things.  All other
things could always be accomplished with the old command.  

How many times have you ever had to reflect about a NNW-SSE line?  Sure,
it's nice to know that it's possible, but I wouldn't worry about making it
particularly efficient.

This philosophy is the same as my reasons for not wanting a "show high
NSEW" command.  Instead, FOUNTAIN should just be changed to allow for a
stepsize.  "high step NSEW" is so useful that it should have a special
command, but "show high NSEW" is fairly uncommon.

It seems to me that having to switch between rectangular blocking
and lassoing would be a huge pain in the ass.  I can well imagine using
both in close alternation.

This reminds me to suggest that you preserve the "interactive" aspect to
blocking.  That is, the currently selected points should be highlighted as
they are selected.  This makes it SO much easier to tell whether you've
really selected the correct region.  This works so well because our whole
situation is "discrete" (i.e., every object consists of points, not lines
or regions).

I like the idea of ESC.  If you want the already defined action,
just press one key.  Otherwise, make the definition.

In fact, any reflection can be made by composing rotations with just one
fixed reflection.  But that's not really the point.  We don't want
to force people to do weird combinations of moves when all they want to do
is turn one simple triangle around.  If things aren't going to be very
simple, then they might as well be the old way.

In my opinion, we could completely deal with all reflections with four icons:
flip NS, flip EW, flip NW-SE, flip NE-SW.  After choosing one, you would
just have to click on any point along the reflection line (or hit ESC). 
I'll use the term "cardinal" from now on to refer to one of these four
directions.

As for shears, dilations, and rotations, I'd make the same kind of
restriction.  Require that the fixed line of the shear be a cardinal line,
and require that the direction of the dilation be along a cardinal (i.e.,
one of the eigenvalues = 1, the other is positive, and the eigenvector of
the latter eigenvalue is cardinal).  In order to dilate in more than one
direction (e.g., 4x4 block to 2x2 block), two dilations would have to be
used.  However, I think that this composition is intuitive enough even for
stunt members to understand. 

To define a dilation, the user would have to click a point on the fixed
line (perpendicular to the direction of dilation) and then move a single
point.  To define a shear, click on the fixed line and move a single
point.  In both these cases, the movement of the point would be restricted
along a line determined by the already-established fixed line.  To define
a rotation, click on the center.

Unfortunately, this makes for a lot of icons: 4 + 4 + 4 + 7 (7 nonidentity
rotations).  Alternately, we could reduce each type of action to a single
icon, and then when the user dragged a direction, the program would "round
off" to the nearest cardinal.

> whatever either from a menu or from an icon.

I like the idea of allowing for more than one way to do something.  Then
hardware specifics are less likely to cause trouble (e.g., only a 1-button
mouse).  I would suggest icons, pulldown-menus, AND keyboard commands.  I
have found that mouse-driven menus (icons and pulldowns) are easier to
learn, but keyboard commands are much faster for experienced users.

I don't see any reason to limit the number of reference points.  Might as
well have as many as desired by the user.

What about rectangular boxes: 55 inches high, 25 inches wide, and 15
inches deep.  Perhaps some simple coloring, too, like white for the upper
half of the front and gold for the upper half of the back.

I'm sorry if my terminology (icons, pulldown menus, etc.) is somewhat
inaccurate.  As I mentioned, I'm not really a programmer, so I don't
know about lots of things that you probably consider elementary.  I hope
my language doesn't make me sound too clueless.

I realized that I used the pronoun "we" several times in this letter.  If
I weren't too lazy, I'd go back and change them to "you" out of respect
for the fact that all I'm doing is answering a few stupid emails.

I don't know about this.  First of all, blatant continuity mistakes are
impossible to simulate accurately by their very nature.  Simulations of
infrequent but large events is not statistically meaningful.  It is much
more plausible to simulate a continuous low-level error such as bad
alignment.  However, this feature won't be useful unless you get 3D
rendering first.  So I'd put it off until after you get that part working.
I'm starting to have some ideas on the mathematical representation of bad
alignment.  After I think about it some more, I'll let you know about it.

I entirely agree that the planar view won't help.  The planar view would
only help for designing things like words or phantom masks, but that's
already fairly easy.

Your ideas are very appropriate.  What makes a block look like a block?
It's not the bandsmen; it's the empty space BETWEEN the bandsmen.  Without
the space in between, the formation consists of nothing more than its border.

The problem is that at twostep spacing, distance between bandsmen is less
than the width of the bandsmen.  Hence, the empty space is bound to be
obscured.  You may have noticed that fourstep blocks almost always look
better than twostep blocks.  However, twostep blocks make the band sound
better.

I'd have to oppose digitization of bandsmen because this would be too
technology dependent - so much memory and processor speed required.  It's
best to have things work on a wide variety of equipment.  I guess it would
be OK if there was also a "primitive rectangle" option.

There is some historical perspective that might be useful in considering
the philosophic value of 3d viewing.  I don't have time to type it right
now since I have to go home to watch the simpsons in 30 minutes.  But I'll
write all about it tomorrow.

Does your new print routine deal with Spring show format?  If not, I would
highly suggest that you stop your current project temporarily and shift
to the printing program.  Right now, it is a fairly high priority to be
able to make decent spring show sheets without having to cut and paste
like we've been doing for the last two years.

Take a look at the harmon ss sheets from the early part of this decade (91
or 92).  They might give you some good ideas.  In particular, notice how
the walls of harmon are printed on the sheets around the grid.  I think
that this is a good idea.  The shape of the stage should definitely be
reflected on the sheets, especially since the grid is actually slightly
larger than the stage.  See if you can get into Zellerbach to take some
measurements.  Or maybe they will be able to give them to you.  Be aware
of the fact that the front of the stage is not straight.

History lesson coming this afternoon.

Orientation is unimportant.  A transformation is called diagonalizable if
it can be diagonalized with respect to SOME basis.  That is, it has two
independent eigenvectors.  These eigenvectors can be in any direction, and
they don't have to be perpendicular, but of course they can't be parallel.

You should definitely keep the old geniusmove around.  I have definitely
been in situations where none of our new proposed actions would work well.
The problem is that compositions of planar transformations is not always
such an obvious thing.  Even someone with a lot of mathematical
background, like you or me, can have a lot of trouble trying to figure out
how to decompose a given transformation into rotations and shears and
things.  And it would certainly be out of the question for a typical
clueless stunt member.

This isn't that important to me.  Either way sounds fine.  I'd go with
whatever seems easier to you.  Actually, I think the shift key method is
better since it's conceivable that someone would try to operate a PC with
a one-button mouse.

And I like the idea of aborting.  ESC should be reserved for aborting in
all contexts, so maybe RETURN for repeat the previous action.  Come to
think of it, this idea could be widened.  If you select some points and
then immediately hit RETURN without selecting an action, then the previous
action is repeated, whatever it is.  If the last command was a flip, then
RETURN will cause a flip.  I'm sure you get the idea.  Of course, there
could also be a "repeat" icon, which could be used as described above, or
it could be used AFTER choosing reflection to mean "apply the most recent
reflection, even if it was not the most recent action."  If this does not
make sense, I'll explain it again.

I suppose that there might be some actions which are inherently
"non-repeatable," such as undo. If you undo an action, you can't select a
group of points and apply the same undo to that group.  In this case,
"repeat-the-last-action" would return an error.  It's probably NOT wise to
simply repeat the most recent repeatable action, since you could end up
accidentally doing something from half an hour ago.

ah, submenu is the way to go.  One icon for each of the types, then a menu

I would suggest that EVERY single feature be executable by menu and by
keyboard.  Also, the commonly used features should appear as
icons.

I think that our idea of "move mode" and "everything-else mode" fits in
with this plan in the following way.  The set of icons does not have to be
fixed.  In move mode, the icons are all of the geniusmove derivatives and
stuff like that.  In the other mode, the icons represent stuff like
continuity select, flip label, etc.

I agree that it's not much of a problem, and sometimes losers are too
dependent on reference points.  They use them in ugly ways to make their
continuity work when there are much simpler and more beautiful ways of
doing it.  However, once or twice I have had a need for 4 reference
points.  In these cases, I've ended up adding extra sheets that were never
printed or distributed.

Ok, I guess there has to be SOME limit because the parser has to be able
to handle the names.  How about 10, which are referenced by the codes R0 - R9?
This seems logical.  Don't deal with deleting reference groups at all. 
Just preserve the current mechanism.  To save memory, don't bother
recording locations if all of the reference points are identical with the
original points.

With this potential problem of file size and the problem with ugly
continuity described above, I would suggest intentionally somewhat
obscuring the fact that there are so many possible reference points by
making it not obvious how to access them unless you know how.  I'm not
sure what this means exactly.  But what I DON'T want is ten icons across
the top of the screen labeled R0 through R9.

See, the problem is that stunt doesn't want a proofing feature.  They want
an exploratory tool.  They want to be able to try out an idea as soon as
they get it to see if it really works as well as their incredibly creative
minds think it will.  So, anything slow is going to end up not being used,
or being used with a huge pain in the ass.

I didn't really mean platform dependent, I meant hardware dependent. 
Slower chips and weaker graphics cards are going to have a major negative
impact on the usefulness of a display with digitized bandsmen.

I think you should just write it to work with Zellerbach.  It's impossible
to try to deal with all possible stage shapes simultaneously.  If it's not
too hard, I would continue to allow to print Harmon sheets just in case we
ever go back.  How often are we going to move?  Once every 30 years? 
Fine, if the bands needs us in 30 years, I pledge to come back and help
rewrite the code for a new stage.

Actually, what we did for the last two years was print out the shows onto
Harmon stuntsheets.  Somewhere, we got a photocopy of a diagram of the
zellerbach stage.  We enlarged it to the proper size, and then we cut a
hole of the proper size and shape inside the diagram.  One by one, we took
the Harmon stuntsheets, covered them with the diagram-and-hole, and
photocopied.  These produced rather unprofessional but still functional
sheets.

I still think that you should print out some features to reflect the
geometry of zellerbach.  It might even help stunt avoid the nearly
insurmountable temptation to design flows requiring people to march
through thin air or into walls.

Geniusmove should be based upon the last three single point moves, not on
the next three moves.  This is because sometimes you actually only need to
move two points to get the g-move you want.  In particular, this occurs
when you want a line to go to another line.  It doesn't matter what
happenned to the third point - the effect on the desired line will be the
same.  So, if I've been moving points around, then I want to g-move a
line, I only need to bother setting two points.

By the way, when you implement geniusmove, don't just copy the old code. 
Read my paper and use the formulae there.  The implemented version of
geniusmove is slightly stupider about checking for degenerate cases.

OK.  Here is an example to think about.  Task: move an 8man NW-SE diagonal
line at 2DM spacing, with the SE-most man on the hash at the 50; to an
8man E-W line at 2HS spacing, with the SE-most man becoming the E-most man
at the hash on the south 40.

1) Move each point individually.  Typical solution for an inexperienced
stunt member.

2) Move two points, then smartmove the rest.  Typical solution for an
experienced stunt member.

3) Select shear, choose N-S direction, and move a single point.  Typical
solution for you, me, or Martin Haye.

Here's the problem.  Someone who thinks he is a hot-shot (I won't name
names) is going to come along and try to be clever in doing this task.  He
looks at the first formation and looks at the second formation.  What does
it look like to him?  Rotate 45deg ccw, then translate.

So, he selects rotate, chooses the proper angle, and clicks on the SE-most
man as the center of rotation.  Uh oh.  There's a problem here.  The
spacing is too big.  That's strange - 2step spacing initially and 2step
spacing in the end.  Must be a bug in the program - have to tell Gurk
about it.

That's Ok.  Fix it by changing the block spacing.  Choose dilation, select
correct direction, and set a point.  NOW what's the matter?  The spacing
looks approximately correct, but it seems that some of the points are a
1/2step out of position!  Son of a bitch.

So, at this point he gives up and tries solution #1.

Do you see the problem here?  The first mistake is obvious - DM does not
equal HS.  But the second mistake is slightly more subtle.  sqrt(2) is
irrational, but the grid is rational.  So the locations of the points gets
rounded off after the first rotation.  This causes small errors later.


I see this as a fairly major problem.  How are we going to teach people to
decompose their transformations properly?  With the old g-move there is
no problem because there is no need for decomposition.

If you think I'm exaggerating in the above example, then you haven't been
around stunt much.

-------------

Martin Haye originally had an idea for a computer program in fall
89 because he was a bad music marker.  He always made mistakes, and then
he was hopelessly confused at rehearsal.  What he wanted to do was input
his location on ss 1 and what he thought his continuity throughout the
show should be.  Then the computer would output the resulting location on
the last stuntsheet.  He could then compare this projection with his
actual location.  If it matched, then most likely there was no mistake, at
least not a large one.

This idea naturally led to more general and powerful ideas.  Martin went
to Briggs with his idea: input the show into the computer, and then print
out 144 text listings of continuity - one for each person.  Save everyone
the trouble of deciphering stuntsheets.

> Actually, stunt correctly did not think much of this idea.  They realized

> the show. 

However, Martin and stunt came to an agreement on a project that would be
very useful.  Input the points into the computer, and print out
nice-looking stuntsheets.  No more tedious pooping parties, no more messy
unreadable handdrawn sheets.

Along the way, it was realized that animation would be fairly easy and
rather useful.  The original intended use of animation was strictly as a
tool for finding charted collisions and reworking flows to avoid them. 

Nowadays, we don't even realize how much of a pain in the butt pregame
rehearsals used to be.  Bandsmen getting in each other's way, stunt
members trying to mentally work out solutions right there on the field. 
The result was really bad continuity like: MT2W, HS2S, MT4W, HS2N, MT2W,
HS16E to position.  These problems are now solved in the computer room
long before the first rehearsal.

So, this determined the whole outlook for the first version: print out
nicelooking sheets and check for collisions.  The interface was designed
with this in mind.  It was expected that people would copy data into the
computer from handdrawn sheets, type in continuity, and then test for
collisions.  If everything worked well, then a printout could be made.

The first version was ready to be used for Fall 90, and ALL of the shows
that year were submitted on paper.  Subsequently, Martin put in the data
and checked for collisions.  About halfway through the season, Greg Jones
(DM90) announced that Martin was looking for help, so I volunteered.  We
worked together for the rest of the season on this task.

The basic method was: about a week before the first rehearsal, get the
sheets from the DM desk, input the data, look for collisions.  Tell stunt
about any problems.  Print out the sheets in time to be sent to the
printers.  That's all there was to it.

In the fall, we learned from experience what worked easily and what was
too cumbersome.  In Spring 91, we made some major changes, primarily to
the user interface, to make the program more efficient for what we
expected to be using it for.  Geniusmove was invented because we kept
having to move these parallelograms one row at a time.  We increased
flexibility of labeling and symbols for cosmetic reasons.  Also, we made
many changes to the continuity assignments and added many new continuity
commands to increase the range of animatable flows.

All along, we fully expected that charters would still be using paper
during their initial creative stages.  In fact, we wrote in the manual
that we thought the program was NOT particularly useful for original work.
In our opinion (expressed in the manual), it was much better to mentally
work out ideas and maybe try them out with the animator to see how they
looked.  The program should only be used as a final check for accuracy.

As an example, I recall that "Insert a sheet" was added fairly late in the
creation of the second version.  We always started at the beginning of a
set of sheets and worked our way through to the end.  Who would ever want
to skip around?  When people started testing their flows with the
animator, we decided that insert might be useful for them.  To us, Insert
is obviously very useful.  But our perspective is different now.

Another example is Hook.  It can be used to relabel, but only in a very
awkward way.  This is because we never intended it to be used for that
purpose.  We wrote Hook (the last major change, by the way) because
different stunt members had written different parts of spring show, and we
wanted to put them all together.  Only afterwards did we realize that
relabeling was possible.

So, we were somewhat surprised when stunt members started doing all their
work at the computer.  This new pattern has caused some changes in the
general flavor of the band's charting.  In particular, stunt members have
become reluctant to try flows that are not animatable on the computer.  I
suppose they fear that the flows may be disasters, and they won't know
until too late.

This explains why the second version has so many apparent shortcomings. 
Such obvious features as reordering stuntsheets are missing.  Some
features are possible but hopelessly cumbersome (like relabeling with Hook).

The third version is going to make HUGE improvements in these neglected
areas.  Now that we know what the program is actually used for, its
interface can be tailored to suit these needs.

>From the experience of the shortcomings of the second version, it is clear
that a very open perspective should be taken with the third version.  I
strongly recommend creating features of doubtful use, just in case someone
wants to use them.  Also, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having
more than one way to do something.  Most likely, at least one of them will
be efficient for any particular purpose.  My all-encompassing single word
of advice is "Generalize!"

This is not a terribly critical issue because reference points are not
used terribly often.  I've always felt that they were always a bit
inherently "ugly" as an abstract concept.  So I'm not terribly concerned
by implementing them in a nice manner.

OK, I'd say that you should put it at the bottom of the list.  Get
everything else working smoothly, then worry about 3D (if you haven't
graduated by then).

Oops, you're right.  I forgot to mention the A line.  I think I know the
reason why it was where it was, but I've never verified this by talking to
an older drum major.  I'll get in touch with Jones to see if he knows.

The floor of Harmon Gym is somewhat wider than 20 yards (distance from A
to E).  So there is some room around the edges of the grid, especially in
the back.  These spaces were used occasionally during marching segment,
especially in the back and on the sides.  Up in the front, the first row
of bleachers was basically right where "4-off-the-A" would be.  So there
was a little bit of room in the front (about two steps), but not a lot. 
In fact, bob's box was placed just off the Aline, as it is now.  So, he
was actually standing on the grid as shown on the harmon sheets.

So that's the reason.  The a line couldn't really be any closer to the
bleachers.  But it WAS physically feasible to place bandsmen west of the
Aline.  So the grid was expanded by 4 steps to accommodate this
possibility.

However, this extra space was not used very often.  It's really a bit too
close to the audience, and it's pretty tough to see bob way down there. 
It was primarily used at times when the flow just wouldn't work without one
more person at the end of the line.

Whatever.  I can't think of any reason why importing is bad.  It would
only make a new stage easier to deal with.  However, I'd be careful in
thinking that being able to set the size of the grid will be helpful.  The
problem is that there are just too many possibilities, with locations of A
lines, non-rectangular shapes, and things like that.  I can't imagine how
all possibilities can be dealt with internally.  Most likely, some changes
are going to have to occur in the code itself.

See history to understand why I place a high value on cool-looking
stuntsheets, not just strictly informative sheets.

I'm not sure if I understand this.  Let me try to explain it back to you. 
At any given moment, a certain transformation type is currently "active"
(translation, shear, rotation, geniusmove, etc.).  If NO points are
currently selected, then leftclicking on a point will move it. 
Rightclicking will smartmove it.  leftdragging will rectangularblock
select points.  rightdragging will lasso select points.

If SOME points are currently selected, then the program is expecting a
transformation definition.  Special key for repeating the last action. 
Special key for unselecting all points and returning to above situation
(abort).  To set fixed points, leftclick on a location (it may be an
actual man, it may not).  To move a point, leftdrag it.  Again, it may or
may not be an actual man.  These motions show up as lines, and the fixed
points show up as dots.  As soon as enough information is given to
uniquely determine an action on the set of selected points, the action
will execute. 

Come to think of it, this isn't exactly what you said.  But I like this idea.
The really neat thing is that different combinations of information can
uniquely determine the action.  For example, any combination of three
fixed points and motions will give a geniusmove.  The program doesn't care
which combination is actually used.  Shears can be determined by a fixed
point and a motion, or by two parallel motions.

Even more interestingly, the shape of the selected set can affect the
amount of necessary information.  In particular, suppose that all of the
selected points lie on a line.  Then it is possible for a geniusmove to be
determined by only two motions.  Or, consider shearing a line in the same
direction as that line (so it's actually just a translation).  This can
require only one piece of information if that one piece is properly chosen.

All of this stuff is mathematically calculatable using determinants and
stuff like that.  If we decide with this interface, I can't wait to draw
up the formulae.

One thing that we should think about is the idea of "editing" the set of
selected points.  What if you accidentally miss one?  There should be a
way to add it to the current set without having to start over.  Notice
that my scheme does not assign any special meaning to the right button
when SOME points are selected.  Perhaps lasso could be used to add or
subtract points.  That is, lassoing selected points will deselect, and
lassoing unselected points will select (this is a NOT operation).

Also, in the old version, points are automatically deselected after an
action.  Maybe this should no longer be the case.  No, come to think of
it, I think that the points should automaticlly be deselected because it
is generally unlikely to be using the same set of points in succession. 
It's more likely that the user will shift to another set.  However, define
a keystroke to "recall last selected set" if desired.

Whenever I had to make circles, I used to get out the hand calculator and
calculated trigonmetrically the locations of the points evenly spaced
around the circle.  Then I rounded off to the nearest halfstep.  A pain in
the ass, but the circles looked good (by definition, as good as possible).

You are absolutely right about 45degree rotations not being necessary.  As
seen in my example of last time, they are only useful for off-the-grid
formations.  So, we'll leave 45deg rotations to old g-move.  This reduces
the number of rotations to three.

Also, if we use the interface described by me above, we only need one
shear icon, not four.  Even if you know the direction of the shear, you
still have to move a point to define it.  But this motion itself gives the
direction of the shear, so there's no point in pre-specifying direction.
Same thing goes for dilations.

As for rotations and reflections, it still seems like a good idea to have
separate icons for each kind of action.  Then these actions would be
defined by a single fixed point (or by a single motion).

I definitely feel like things are clicking into place.  This interface is
going to be BY FAR better than anything either you or me could have
designed by ourselves.  I tell you, there's nothing quite so useful as
partner to bounce ideas off of.

The subject of the shape of the Zellerbach grid has come up in several
contexts recently: writing the field setup manual, and also redesigning
CalChart.

Anyway, I've pieced together all the different aspects and have come to an
opinion as to the best solution to the problem.  It is:

Set the A line to be as close to the audience as possible so that the
ENTIRE line actually exists.  That is, it should just barely clear the
gaps on the sides of the pit.  Then, there will be enough room for the
B,C, and D lines.  Past the D line, there will be something around 4 or 6
steps to the back curtain (somebody should go to Zellerbach to measure
this so that stunt can chart properly).  Also, in front of the A line,
there will be about 2 steps for most (but not all) of the distance between
the 40yard lines (again, someone should take measurements to figure out
exactly how much room there really is).

To accommodate this space in front of the A line, the stuntsheets should
be changed slightly so that the grid starts 4 steps in front of the A line
(see the old Harmon sheets if you don't understand my description).

These are my reasons for this opinion.  First, it will be much easier for
field setup to tape the stage accurately if they don't have to worry about
dealing with gaps in the A line.  Much more importantly, it will be easier
for bandsmen to march if they don't have to deal with gaps in the A line.

As for rehearsals, it will be very easy for field setup to extend the
yardlines a few additional steps to the west.

There you go.

I still think that we don't quite have the same mental picture of what is
going on.  I'll try to explain again what I'm thinking, with a few minor
changes (improvements, theoretically) from my last explanation.

First of all, let's permanently establish some terminology so that we can
understand each other.  Part of our problem is that our language is
ambiguous.  Anything that appears in quotes can be considered as a
permanent definition.  "Man" is a little circle with a label.  "Point" is
ANY location on the field, occupied by a man or not.  "Action" is
something that happens to a set of men, such as label flip, change symbol,
translate, rotate, geniusmove.  Note that a set can consist of a single
point.  Thus, normal individual move and smartmove are actions.  "Icon" is
something off of the field that can be selected for some purpose.

You sit down at the computer and start working on the show.  You've got a
stuntsheet in front of you.  If you leftclick on a man, it will
temporarily disappear.  When you leftclick again, it will reappear at the
current cursor location.  This is called "individualmove."

If you rightclick on a man, it will be immediately moved by "smartmove."
The new location is calculated as the next term in the linear sequence
generated by the destinations of the two most recent individualmoves or
smartmoves.

If you leftdrag, you will "rectaselect" (rectangular select).  If you
rightdrag, you will "lassoselect." At this point, we have not yet decided
exactly what will happen if you rectaselect or lassoselect WHILE some
points are already selected.  Either the original selection will
disappear, or the new selection will be NOTed with the old selection.
 
If you click on an icon while some points are selected, the corresponding
action will be executed on the selected set.  Some actions will occur
immediately: label flip, autocont, etc.  Some actions might require more
information: translation, rotation, geniusmove, etc.

If you do choose an action that requires more information, the program
expects this new information to be entered immediately.  The next inputs
will be interpreted as information to explicitly define the action to be
executed.  The actual method of inputting this data will be somewhat ad
hoc (each action will have its own protocol).  We haven't even discussed
lots of these things, such as symbol change, continuity assign, etc.

This protocol for the entire "gmove family" will be somewhat similar. 
Leftclick on any POINT and then leftclick again to set the point's
destination at the current cursor location.  To set a fixed point, just
doubleclick on a point.  A line (or dot in case of fixed point) will
appear to describe the entered data, but no men will yet be moved.  When a
sufficient amount of information has been entered, the action will execute.

If you select an icon and execute an action, the icon remains "current." 
The current icon will affect the way that some things work.  For example,
if any of the gmove family is current, then leftclick is used
for individual move.  However, if label flip is current, then leftclick
will flip a label.  We have yet to work out the full details of this. 
There is a "nullmove" icon that can be selected in case something like
label flip is current, but you want leftclick to be used for individual move.

Underlying all of this structure are the obvious things like abort, undo
last command, redo last action, select all, select none, etc.

--------

That's the end of my formal explanation.  Now for more informal
discussion.  The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that what
I have described above is the way to go.  Note that the set of visible
icons can change, dependent on which icon is current.  Of course, some
things should always be visible, such as nullmove (I imagine that we will
find a need for other null actions, such as nullrefpoint or
nullsymbolchange), so that the informal concept of mode can be changed. 
However, EVERYTHING can always be accessed by using menus, no matter which
icons are actually visible.  Some commands won't make sense unless certain
icons are current - for example, zap won't do anything unless one of the
refpoint-related icons is current. 

The idea here is that there is no need for a formal definition of mode. 
The state of the interface is determined by the general type of the most
recent action.  If you last did a rotation, that's move mode.  If you last
changed a plainman to a solidbackslashman, that's symbol mode.

> 
> Yeah, you don't need to point that out.  Well, off to concert band.

Last night while lying in bed (that's where I do most of my thinking about
calchart), I came up with a great idea for a brand new feature.  Recall
the meaning of NP (nextpos) in continuity language.  We should install PP
(prevpos) in the obvious way - I've definitely had a use for it in the past.

That's a good idea, but it's not quite the great idea I had.  The great
idea occurred when I noticed the similarity in the way that NP and R1 are
treated by the continuity language.  In some sense, NP is the "zeroth
reference point."  We should install a feature that shows the next
stuntsheet or the previous stuntsheet in purple concurrently with the current
stuntsheet.  This would be a huge help to people designing shows right at
the console, and even more help to people trying to fix collisions and
making small changes like switching two men.  Hell, why not allow ANY
other stuntsheet to be superimposed?

Moreover, we should just allow simultaneous display of another sheet. 
Normally, even when another sheet is superimposed, all actions are applied
ONLY to men on the current sheet.  However, if the user prespecifies, all
subsequent actions will be applied to the OTHER sheet.  This works in
the same way that refmode currently works in the old version.

There is a small amount of danger in that this feature is very powerful,
and users can accidentally make edits to other sheets without realizing
it.  So, the request that changes occur on the OTHER sheet should probably
NOT be accessible by an icon - it would be too easy to accidentally click
on it and then get into trouble REAL fast.  Also, we should restrict the
allowable actions only to move-related actions.  You can move points if
you want, but you can't change symbols or redefine continuity.

The purpose for this feature is to prevent the necessity of switching back
and forth between two stuntsheets every 15 seconds while edits are being made.

Here is something that we need to clarify.  What happens if you reselect
immediately after selecting men?  I suggested a NOT feature, so that the
set of points could easily be amended.  You suggested that reselecting
would immediately erase the old selection.  The problem here is that both
ideas have advantages, but of course only one can actually be implemented.
One or the other will have to be implemented by keystroke.

It seems to me that usually when I make a mistake in blocking, it is
because I missed a few points on the end, or I caught a few extras. 
Generally, it would be very easy to amend if the old version had such a
feature.

Sometimes I would make a mistake like: "oops, I wanted the south half of
the block, not the north half of the block."  In this kind of situation,
your idea would be more helpful.

However, without doubt the first kind of mistake occurs much more often. 
Therefore, I propose we go with the NOT feature.

More ideas, but I've got to run right now.

Based on your responses below, I can tell that we are converging to the
same mental picture.  However, we're not quite there yet.  I'll try to
clarify some more.

Well, it's a NOT or an XOR, depending on how you look at it.  I was
thinking of the first selection as establishing truth and falsity for each
point.  Then the values within the second selection would be NOTed.  On
the other hand, you can think of both the first and second selection as
inputs for the XOR.  Anyway, it's the same thing.

There should definitely be a way to subtract points from a selection. 
Too many points are accidentally selected as often as too few are.  ORing will
not provide this capability.  Maybe hold one key for adding points (OR)
and another for removing ({first} AND NOT{second}).

OK.  That's possible.  But we're going to have to deal with the fact that
once the action is determined uniquely, you can't add new information in
any arbitrary fashion.  We'll have to work out some way of "editing" the
data describing the action.  In some cases, this will be easy.  for
example, if you incorrectly set the center of a rotation, just reclick on
the new center.  But the actions that require more than one piece of
information or variable amounts of information will be more tricky.

Here is one of the issues that I did not make clear to you.  Selection is
what happens under the "normal" state of affairs.  However, once you click
on an icon, the program immediately expects action data, not selection
data.  Let's say you want to do a rotation.  FIRST select all the points
that will be rotated.  Get the set of points exactly right.  THEN click on
the rotation icon.  Now the program expects the next click to be the
center of rotation.  So, there's no ambiguity - the program knows from
context whether the information is to be used to define the action or to
select points.

Even if the desired icon is current, you STILL have to click on it if you
want to execute the same action again.

Here is the idea I have in mind.  Leftclick and rightclick are the two
easiest forms of input for human bodies.  Thus, we should try to make
these two things as useful as possible.  If I'm setting lots of symbols, I
don't give a fuck that smartmove can be executed at a moment's notice by
pressing the right mouse button.  In that sense, it's a "waste of
convenience" to have rightclick ALWAYS mean smartmove.

How can the program guess what meaning for rightclick would be most
convenient for the user?  Of course it can't always tell, but it can make
a good guess based on the most recently executed action.  If the last
action was changing a block of symbols, then it seems pretty likely that
the next command will also be symbolchange.  It doesn't HAVE to be this
way, but symbolchange is the most likely of all the possibilities. 
Therefore, immediately after a symbolchange, rightclick should cause a
symbolchange for the man at the cursor location.  To symbolchange a
selected set, the user would still have to click on the symbolchange icon
(or on the repeat-last-action icon).
 
Sometimes the program will guess wrong.  It will suspect that another
symbolchange is coming, but in fact smartmove really is the next thing I
want to do.  How can I reestablish the meaning of rightclick to be
smartmove?  I would have to perform a move-related action, and then the
program would change the meaning of rightclick to be smartmove.  But I
don't want to do anything except for smartmove.  So I can click on the
nullmove icon, which is move-related but doesn't cause any changes in the
location of men.

I'll try to clarify my meaning sentence by sentence.  If I've just
clicked on a transformation icon, all I can do is enter data to define the
transformation (or abort).  However, if a transformation icon is current
(i.e., the most recent action) then rightclick means smartmove.

If men are selected, then I'm not sure what rightclick should mean.  Maybe
it shouldn't mean anything since the purpose of selecting men is to choose
an action by clicking on an icon.  I think that a special meaning under
this special circumstance would be confusing.

If symbolchange is the current icon (ie, most recently executed action),
then rightclick will be individualsymbolchange.  If labelflip is the
current icon, then rightclick is individuallabelflip.

After you select men, you must ALWAYS specify the action by clicking on
the desired icon (or using the menu or keyboard) or by choosing a special
command such as repeat-last-action.  If you want to symbolchange different
blocks simultaneously, FIRST select ALL of them, then click on the
appropriate icon.

Notice that I've only talked about rightclick having a varying purpose.  I
think that it is a good idea to leave leftclick set on individualmove. 
First of all, individualmove is so useful so often.  Second, smartmove is
obscure enough to start with that people will not be terribly confused if
their right button keeps changing purpose.  Also, notice that I am always
distinguishing between leftclick and leftdrag, as in the old version.

> 
> You can move men while viewing the refpoints in the old version?

I didn't mean EXACTLY the same way.  I meant that the concept of
overlaying other sets of points in purple (or some other color), while
only the "topmost" layer could actually be changed.

You've got the idea on this.  I'll trust your opinion on the best method
of implementation since you've seen this kind of thing before.  You are
certainly correct that only the topmost sheet should be editable - WAY too
confusing any other way.

I've never studied much game theory formally, but there was a little of it
in Econ 103 (mathematical economics).  I really liked the course.  It is
taught by Debreu, who is a nobel laureate in econ, and the only
prerequisite is math 50AB (no econ requirement at all).

I was wondering what to do with rightclick while defining actions, and I
think we've got the answer.  Remember that we are going to use lines to
represent the data that has already been entered.  How about rightdrag
either endpoint to move THAT point but leave the other endpoint fixed? 
This makes me realize that we will need different colors to distinguish
between source and destination endpoints.  How to completely kill an
entry?  Double rightclick on either endpoint?

Isn't it amazing how sometimes you get started on an idea, and you think
you are improving it, but really you are missing the truly clear solution
simply because you started in the wrong frame of mind.  You have certainly
greatly demistified the situation.  The point is this: my informal concept
of mode really meant an option to define rightclick to be what you want.

As for the specific comment about 8 symbol modes, I think it may be better
to base the symbolrelated commands on the concept of having a current
symbol, and then all commands will operate relative to THAT symbol.  This
is essentially the way that the current version works, but icons will make
choosing a new symbol much easier.

I'm a little worried that we've got too many icons.

Yes, I think that you are right about everything in the preceding paragraph.

Best for me would be the X version.  We've got a couple of sun 3/50s and
3/60s with B+W monitors and two sun sparcstation 5s with color monitors in
our computer room.  I will have a bit of trouble trying to find a pc with
enough hardware.  The one drawback of testing the X version is that I
won't be able to find any bugs that are related to the operating system in
which the program is actually going to be used.  However, that's not my
specialty anyway.  Even with the X version, I'll get a very good sense for
what it's like to work with the interface.  Looking forward eagerly to
getting a chance to test it!

I like the idea of having a dot at the source end and just the end of the
line at the origin.  This will make the display of fixed points nice.  It
will look like a source endpoint without any line attached.

Remember that the left button is to be used for creating NEW data.  so it
can't also mean move an endpoint, unless the maximum amount of data has
already been entered.  I suppose leftclick could be for new data, and left
drag for altering old data.
 
What do you mean by "exit and go into block move?"  I'm not sure what
"block move" is.  Maybe you mean that the action should be aborted.  In
that case, the program would return to the state where the original
selected set is still selected, and it is waiting either for an alteration
to the selected set or the choice of some action.  Maybe you mean "block
move" in the old version sense.  But we've done away with block move and
replaced it with the translation action, which is a member of the g-move
family.

>

Well, I don't want to think of it as a separate mode.  Think of it as
analogous to the situation with the g-move family.  After choosing an
action, the user has to give more information (lines with endpoints,
etc.).  Similarly, when change symbol is chosen, more information must be
given.  In particular, the user must specify to WHICH symbol should the
selected set be changed.  So a little window with eight icons pops up, and
the user clicks on one.

I like the idea trying to make the implementation of all actions somewhat
uniform.  The basic structure is: first select some points; second choose
an action; third give more information to define the action precisely.

For example, change-continuity-assignment should work as follows.  choose
your set of points.  then click on the change-cont-assignment icon.  Then
a list of all continuities appears.  click on the desired continuity.  The
default value would be whichever continuity group was most recently used
for any purpose.
 
> 
> Hopefully some things can be tucked away in menus.

I think we'll be able to manage somehow.  for example, we could put all of
the g-move family under a single icon.

OK, whatever.  I don't know anything about this, and I don't fully
understand what you are saying.  so I'll take your word for it that my
testing will be useful.

Another random idea that came to me recently: alternate ways of selecting
points other than rectangular-select and lasso-select.  One should be able
to type a list of labels (with shorthand as in old program) to be
selected.  The most recently used list would remain a default value, so
that this feature could be very useful if for some reason the symbols of
men A1, B6, and T3 had to be changed on every single stuntsheet.

Also, one should be able to select points by specifying a symbol.  Choose
solidman, and all solidmen would be selected.  This has obvious uses,
especially for refpoints.  These two methods should be usable in
conjunction with each other and with rectangular-select and lasso-select.
That is, it should be possible to OR and XOR them in all possible ways.

I'm absolutely certain that when you get down to details, you'll discover
that we forgot lots and lots of things.  It is impossible to think of
everything ahead of time when you are dealing with a program as
complicated as this.

Does Microsoft have a position for full-time interface designer?  I think
I'd like that job.

I'm still not clear on what you are saying.  How is the left button action
= translation?  Do you mean individualmove?  If so, it is best to think of
the translation action and individualmove as separate things.  In fact, it
seems to me that individualmove is actually the unique exception in our
overall consistent structure of actions.  I'm not disapproving, I'm just
clarifying the status of individualmove.

In my opinion, I think that endpoints on top of start points will be a
problem.  If we're trying to make it easy to input and change the data,
then why force the user to input in a certain order?  Here's a compromise.
Right click either endpoint to kill.  Left click to input new data.  Left
drag an existing endpoint to edit.

But what happens if two lines share the same endpoint?  How does the
program know which one to edit or kill?  Imagine the worst case, where two
lines are inverses of each other (same line, but source and destination
reversed).  In this case, there is literally no way to distinguish between
the two with the mouse.  A keyboard or menu solution will have to be
implemented.

A rotation requires one point: the center of rotation.  Shears and
dilations can be defined by one movement if the movement is chosen wisely. 
As in shear, the way to define a dilation is by 1 click and 1 movement or
by 2 parallel movements.  Reflections can be defined by one movement (the
reflection line will be the perpendicular bisector).

With the exception of rotation, everything should be thought of as a
movement.  If you want a fixed point, just double click (once for source,
and immediately follow with the destination).  Therefore, dilation and
shear are only described by 2 parallel point movements, where the 0vector
is considered to be parallel to any other vector.  And reflection is
only described by a movement (possibly a 0movement).

For the rotation case, the interface should change slightly.  There is no
need for a destination, so leftclicking once will set the center of rotation. 
Right click will delete it, and leftdrag will move it. 

Note that not all movements will make sense in all circumstances.  For
example, a movement in reflection MUST be in the direction perpendicular
to the reflection line.  Also, dilations and shears can only deal with
parallel movements.  I'm not sure how the user interface should deal with
this.  For reflections, it seems fairly easy: after you click on the
source, the cursor will only move along the line perpendicular to the
direction of the reflection line, even if the mouse is moved in other
directions.  I guess you'd say that the cursor is the "orthogonal
projection" of the mouse position onto the line.  Am I being too unclear?

For dilations and shears, the situation seems more difficult.  Making a
similar restriction (only for the second line, since the first line can be
anything) will make editing data extremely difficult.  Maybe the program
will accept any data and then complain when it tries to implement an
impossible dilation.

In every case but rotation, translation, and reflection, some sets of data
are ambiguous.  For starters, source endpoints can NOT coincide.  For a
shear, the two parallel lines can NOT be of the same length.  For a
dilation, the lines again can NOT be of the same length.  In addition, the
line between the two source points can NOT be perpendicular to the
direction of dilation.

I've got to run, but I'll be back with more comments.

And this concept will work for other modes.  If you want to type in new
continuity, select the editcont icon, then choose the group from a list. 
Then a text window appears.

If you want to flip labels, select the label icon, then choose flip,
right, or left.  As always, the most recent is the default.

I like the idea of highlighting selected points in the animation.  I guess
we could work it the same way as always.  Click on the animate icon for
animation, but if you want to highlight some points, then FIRST select,
then click on animate.

I wouldn't bother with prespecifying the percussion spots.  It's not going
to be used very often, and it just feels kind of cumbersome and unnatural. 
On the other hand, maybe we should install it, just in case someone
decides several years from now that they really want it.  OK, I've
convinced myself now that it is a good idea.

The names of groups of points should be text, as for continuity
assignments.  One can select points by asking for a group name.  To change
group definitions, select points and then use an appropriate action.  It
is possible for one man to lie in more than one group.

There should be two kinds of groups - local and global.  Global groups
apply to every single stuntsheet - change it's definition on one sheet,
and you change it on every sheet simultaneously.  This is useful for
things like studying the percussion line or the basses in pregame.

Local groups only apply to a particular stuntsheet.  They have no bearing
on other sheets, and probably there don't even exist groups on other
sheets with the same name.  Even if there is another local group on
another sheet with the same name, the two groups are completely indepedent.

What about groups that exist on more than one stuntsheet but not all?  Forget
it - just use a global group and ignore it where you don't want it.

Oh, this is getting better and better.  Notice that the notion of symbol
is really just a special type of local group - one that happens to affect
the printout.  Note that continuity assignments are also just local groups
- they happen to affect animation.  Even labels are singleton global
groups.  I really really really like the idea that we have generalized
several seemingly distinct concepts into one unifying idea!  I don't know
much about coding, but I suspect that this concept will be useful for you
in writing the program.

What about the idea of applying actions to global groups with the intent
of applying that action on every stuntsheet?  I'm a little wary of this
because a user could really fuck things up in a hurry by misusing this
tool.  On the other hand, relabeling a show is really an action on the
global groups defined by label.  Some commands would be more useful than
others.  For example, symbol would probably be used, but movement actions
would not likely be useful.  Who cares?  There's nothing wrong with
implementing options that are even more powerful than necessary. 

Allowing global actions is going to mean that sometimes there will be a
use for groups that are defined on more than one sheet but not all.  So,
we'll need some way to create such things - shouldn't be too hard.

Now, I have a whole new way of thinking about symbol, continuity, labels,
etc.  I have a feeling that after I think through this, I'm going to have
some new ideas on things like labels that change during a show, autocont,
and so forth.

I realize that most of the stuff I'm talking about has little or no use. 
But the point of the new version is to make things more powerful, so why
not install it?  Can you imagine trying to explain this to stunt?  They'll
NEVER understand it.  See what a casual little comment by one person can
inspire another to do?

You know what the really cool thing about having you work on the new

Mellos OWN calchart.

I'm not sure about the old file format, but I seem to remember something
about it.  The very first Calchart show was pregame 90, so if it works for
that show, then it should work on anything.

Oh, this is a very very BAD BAD idea.  Don't even TELL stunt about this
because they will probably think it is cool.  The influence of calchart on
our marching style is bad enough - this would blatantly exacerbate the
situation.  I mean, if we keep going the way we are, we'll end up with a
program that WRITES the shows.  The one advantage of this is that stunt
could then be disbanded.  It's ok to allow some aspects to remain under
human control.

actually, i'm probably not qualified for them.  you probably have to have
a lot of programming experience so that you can understand how hard it
would be to actually implement ideas.


I've changed my mind about the whole rightclick controversy that we went
through last week.  We had finally decided that there should be a way to
redefine the meaning of rightclick, completely independently of everything
else that is going on.  I've decided that this is just not worth it. 
Instead, rightclick should ALWAYS mean individual-select.  It would be
exactly the same as making a very small rectangle about one man, EXCEPT
that if points are already selected, then rightclicking will NOT kill the
old selection - instead, it will XOR.  This way, you could rightclick two
men consecutively, and both would then be highlighted.  This situation is
nearly as good as being able to redefine the meaning of rightclick. 
Instead specifying the meaning and THEN rightclicking on men, you now have
to rightclick on men and THEN specify the action.

This still leaves the question of how to deal with smartmove.  Like
individualmove, smartmove should be considered as a bit of an exception to
the normal structure of actions.  First, individually move two points with
leftclick.  Then, click on the smartmove icon.  From now on, ALL clicks
(both left and right) will execute smartmoves.  This situation will last
until it is actively aborted by the user (hit ESC, I guess).

How about left click for the original smartmove, and rightclick for
"negative smartmove."  The point jumps into line, but it gets added on the
"negative" end of the line, not the positive end.  I honestly can't think
of a good use for this, but what the hell?  I guess that's easy for me to
say - I don't have to write the code.  :)

Now I'm trying to think of a way to implement a twodimensional smartmove. 
This could be very useful.  I'll have to spend some time pondering this.

As I understood it, if you select some points and then leftclick on one,
it won't do anything.  In order to get a translation, you have to click
the translate icon, then input one movement vector.

I don't understand your explanation at the beginning of the paragraph.  If
the two lines are identical, how can you move one without moving the other
in a natural way?  Clicking in ANY location will not distinguish between
the two overlapping lines.

I think it is more logical to have left for new data, and right for
editing existing data.  And delete or escape as you suggest for removing data.
However, we STILL have to deal with the potential problem of overlapping
endpoints.

It's true that we agreed to limit the possible directions of reflection
lines.  However, it is not always natural to define a reflection by
clicking on the fixed line.  If you want to reflect a box about the line
passing down its middle, then it's easy to click on the fixed line.  But
let's say that a block is going to reflect and end up 20 yards south. 
Then the fixed line would lie somewhere in between the original location
of the block and the final destination.  You would have to mentally
calculate the distance, then divide by two, blah, blah to find the fixed
line.  Much easier to just move one man.

So, we should allow EITHER definition: (double) click on the fixed line OR
move one man.  This means that we cannot allow the direction of reflection
to be defined by the direction of movement, because if you want to define
a point on the fixed lie, then there is no implicit direction.  I think
that the best solution is to prespecify the direction of the axis.  If
the user specifies a movement, it will snap to the only possible direction
of motion (perpendicular to reflection line).

Sure, this makes sense.  I wasn't really making an observation on the
interface.  This had more to do with the fact that the routine would have
to have some internal error-checking.



I've been thinking about the 2dimensional smartmove.  One problem that i
have is that I can't think of a good way to make it a strict
generalization of original smartmove.  By this, I mean that I can't design
it in such a way that 1dimensional smartmove is still just as easy to use
as the oldfashioned smartmove.  So, it would have to be implemented as a
separate feature: say, "clevermove."

Here is my idea for clevermove.  Maybe you will have a good idea to
improve it.  The input is destinations p1, p2, and p3 of the three most
recent individualmoves (analogously, smartmove has inputs destinations p1
and p2 of the two most recent individualmoves).  Think of p1 as the base
point; in actual application, it would be the SE corner of a block. Also,
p2 is the man next to p1 on the east face of the block, and p3 is the man
behind p1 on the south face of the block.

Set v2 = p2 - p1, and v3 = p3 - p1.  So v2 represents the NS spacing, and
v3 represents the EW spacing.  When you invoke clevermove, a cursor
appears at p1 + 2 v2 (just to the north of p2).  Whenever you rightclick
on a point, it is immediately moved into the position occupied by the
cursor.  Simultaneously, the cursor automatically increments by v2 (moves
another 2 steps to the north).  In fact, this might be a really nice
graphical way of dealing with smartmove - it would make it easier to
remember what's going on.

Now, the cursor can be moved outside of its automatic increment.  Press
the right arrow key, and the cursor location is incremented by v2.  Press
the left arrow key, and the cursor location is incremented by -v2.  Use up
arrow key for incrementing by v3, and down arrow for incrementing by -v3.

Using the arrow keys, it would be really easy to move around a block.  One
problem is that the user might have to keep going back and forth between
arrows and mouse.  so maybe we should use the A,S,W,Z keys in addition to
arrows so that the user could press keys with his left hand and use the
mouse with his right.

There should also be a special key that would send the cursor to position p1 +
(n+1) v3 whenever the cursor is currently at position p1 + m v2 + n v3. 
In application, this means that if you are currently working on the third
NS line, you can easily jump to the south end of the fourth NS line.  Sort
of like a typewriter's carriage return.

I know it's not perfect.  Maybe it's so cumbersome that it's not even
worth implementing.  What do you think?  At the very least, it's got a
good name.  "Clever" is more than "smart" but less than "genius."

I thought you would like this notion.  As a mathematician, the general
idea of unifying separate concepts into one theory is very appealing. 
With the exception of the time when Martin originally conceived the idea
for Calchart, I think that this is the biggest development in calchart
"theory."

I'm not sure what you mean by masking, so please explain in more detail by
giving an example or something.  It seems from what you are saying that
this will solve the problem of having groups that are on more than one
stuntsheet but not ALL stuntsheets.

More thoughts on groups.  Groups should be very flexible.  No reason why
global groups have to consist of the same labels on all sheets.  For
example, there could be a global group for the easternmost line of men in
each formation.  I don't know how this would be useful, but it might be.

Symbol groups should be given the names "PLAIN", "SOLID", "BKSL", etc. as
in the old program.  Global label groups should be given the name
corresponding to their labels:  "A1," "69", "B0", etc.  These groups
should be accessible from the general group menu, but perhaps should not
appear automatically since there will always be many many label groups. 
The program should forbid the creation of any group that coincides with a
symbol group name or a label group name.  It should be impossible for any
man to lie in more than one local symbol group.

ANY local group can have continuity text assigned to it.  Usually, only symbol
groups get continuity text.  This removes the necessity for a separate
command to create a new continuity group.  Just create a new local group
and assign it continuity.

What about global groups getting continuity?  I'll have to think about
what this means.  This could be kind of useful - if you want to specify
unique continuity for 69, you could just put it in 69's label group. 
Maybe this is getting out of control.

Also, what happens when a man lies in more than one local group with
associated continuity text?  There would have to be a rule of precedence
to determine which continuity actually gets applied.  I suppose that
symbol groups have the highest precedence.  There is no need to set
precedence between different symbol groups since they are mutually
exclusive.  After symbol, I guess alphabetical order would work.  After
all, this rule will only need to be applied when the user fucks up and
accidentally redundantly assigns continuity.

What about concatenating continuity in the case of redundant assignment?
Think about this kind of flow, which happens fairly often.  For the first
16 beats, plain and solid do the same thing, but slash and bksl do
something else.  Then for the second 16 beats, plain and slash do the same
thing, but solid and bksl do something else.  This could be implemented by
assigning each man to two continuity texts, which are to be executed in
succession.  But now how is the order of execution defined?  

This would reduce the amount of typing necessary, but would so greatly
increase confusion that I doubt anyone would ever use it.  In fact, I
would probably only use it because I thought it was a cool capability, not
because it was actually more efficient.

Well, I'm thinking about loosening our restrictions on labels.  By
thinking of things in terms of groups, some ideas that seemed originally
cumbersome now become much more natural.  I'm not going to say anything on
it now - you'll have to wait until I have a consistent theory.

Here's just a taste.  We already talked about global label groups.  There
are also two-sheet animation groups which consist of a single man on each
of a pair of consecutive sheets.  These pairings determine origin and
destination for the animation.  Currently, the animation groups are
derived directly from the label groups.  What if that requirement is
dropped?  What about the requirement that animation groups associate men
on adjacent sheets?  What does it mean that man B1 on stuntsheet 3 goes to
man A5 on stuntsheet 31?  What about dropping the requirement that label
groups (or animation groups) are singletons?

Anyway, I'm sure you see the point.  Admittedly, all of this stuff seems
pretty useless, but in the interest of "Generalize!", it might be wise to
actually implement in such a way that it doesn't interfere with normal usage.
We could hide the stuff away in obscure sub-sub-menus if necessary.

Another real problem with the difficulty-meter is that it will only
measure difficulty in ways that the programmers thought of.  For example,
one obvious thing is to count the number of pivots required.  Or the
amount of marktime.  But how does one quantify difficulty of alignment, or
the fact that lines are supposed to pop in countermarches?

Let's be perfectly honest about the use of our neat new ideas - they're
really not a whole lot more than toys for stunt and even more for us. 
Really, the old version is perfectly good for everything stunt has to do. 
It's not like the old version is so hard to use that it prevents stunt
from doing its job.

Different from the old version is just fine.  There are so many other
changes that this one won't make any difference.

You hit the nail on the head when you observed that the order of entering
the men is not apparent.  That's why smartmove has to be an exception to
the normal rule of select first, act second.  It defeats the purpose of
smartmove if you have to prespecify the men in the order that you want to
move them.  Smartmove is used mostly when stunt charts scatterflows in
pregame.  They want to be able to make up the order as they go - they
don't want to click on points and then move them all at once.

A lot of this relates to my previous letter on clevermove.  If I were to
implement a circle-locator, this is how I would do it.  I'm not sure on
the exact method of inputting data, but here's an outline.  Define the
circle by locating the center and a "base point" on the circumference. 
This uniquely determines a circle.  alternatively, you could define a
circle by clicking on the center and dragging to set the radius.  However,
even with the mouse method you still need a "base point" on the
circumference.  Next define the interval between men in terms of central
angle; equivalently, specify the number of points to be evenly placed all
the way around the circle.

Now, the first rightclick will zap a man onto the base point.  successive
rightclicks will zap men into position around the circle counterclockwise.
Leftclicks zap men into position clockwise.

As for freehand shapes, there is going to be a very big problem in that it
is EXTREMELY difficult to draw a smooth curve freehand with a mouse.  How
in the world could a user input the shape of a mask?  It would NEVER look
right - it would probably be better to just do it the oldfashioned way.  I
suppose a mask could be constructed piecewise out of smooth curve-makers
that you see in drawing programs.  But then you're going to have trouble
ensuring that the boundary between pieces is smooth.  I see this as a
hopeless obstruction, although it would be really nice to be able to set
the scriptcal in a systematic way.  Any suggestions?

Algorithmically speaking, smartmove can be implemented like this: when you
click on a point, it gets moved to p1 + n (p2 - p1), and n is incremented
by one.  Notation is the same as in the other letter.  For negative
smartmove, leftclick causes the man to be moved to p2 + m (p1 - p2), and m
is incremented by one.  Note that m and n are independent variables.  This
is very simple, and provides no obstruction to the implementation of
negative smartmove.  The same basic idea can be used for the
counterclockwise/clockwise problem in the circle case.

It seems that our positions on this issue have reversed!  You are now the
proponent for "easy usage," and I am the proponent of "consistent
interface."  I can't think of any contradictions with your idea for rapid
translations, so I guess it will work.  However, there should still be an
icon for translation.

Either I'm very confused, or we're not talking about the same thing,
because this makes no sense to me.  Here is a very explicit description of
what I am imagining.

There is a block of men centered at the 50.  The user wants to reflect
this block about the 50 (so that the position of the block as a whole does
not actually move).  Being an old-fashioned kind of guy, he doesn't use
the reflection action; he's going to do it with geniusmove.  He selects
the block, and then chooses the geniusmove icon.  Now he clicks on the man
on the north 40 at the hash, and clicks again on the south 40 at the hash
(so a horizontal line 20 yards long appears).  Now, he clicks on the man
on the south 40 at the hash, and clicks again on the north 40 at the hash
(so a horizontal line 20yards long appears).  Finally, he clicks on a man
on the 50, and clicks again on the same point.

Now he suddenly realizes that he actually wanted to reflect about the
south 45, not the 50.  So he wants to edit his data.  But the horizontal
lines are on top of each other.  Even the endpoints coincide.  How can he
clearly communicate to the program that he wants to edit the
southward-pointing vector, NOT the northward-pointing vector?  Simply
using the mouse is impossible; there will have to be some keyboard
solution (use SPACE to select through a series?).

Almost never will this situation actually arise, but sometimes it will. 
Of course, if source points agree and destination points agree, then the
two vectors are identical, so the program should not consider them as
separate data entries.  However, in my example the orientations were
reversed, so the two vectors were NOT the same.

This seems to be the only possible solution.  I hadn't thought of the
reference point situation, but you are right that this is a major pain
with the old version.  Especially since refpoints very often coincide.

Come to think of it, this cycling mechanism should apply to individualmove
and to any other similar situation.

Considering our new implementation, the cursor is a good idea for
oldfashioned smartmove, regardless of clevermove.  Remember that the user
will click on the smartmove icon.  At this time the smartmove cursor
appears.  When the user aborts the smartmove, the icon disappears.

There should be a way to "continue" the most recent smartmove, even after
aborting.

Anyway, clevermove is just an idea.  We can decide about it later.  It's
certainly one of those things that can be added later, since it will be
fairly easy to implement once smartmove already works.  I'd say go for it
in all of its cursors-and-arrow-keys glory, but I don't have to write the
code.  :)  Clevermove will never "get in the way" since it has to be
intentionally invoked by clicking on an icon.

I just realized that your "masking" and my ideas are really the same.  It
had occurred to me that there really is no such thing as a local group
since any group that only appears on one stuntsheet can be thought of as a
global group that happens to equal the empty set on all other sheets.  So,
"A POINTS" is really only one group, where the men in the group might vary
from sheet to sheet.

I think you figured out what I was saying halfway through your paragraph. 
We really aren't changing the WAY continuity is assigned, we are just
changing our viewpoint of it.

I'll address mutual exclusivity in the GUT.

Just to warn you, I think it's going to get even wilder.  I don't think
that the interface is a big concern on this issue.  It's not like these
things are particularly useful.  I'm more concerned over the question of
whether they should be POSSIBLE or not.

Ugh!  Splines are really rather messy.  I guess it wouldn't be too bad if
the user clicked on some points to define a spline.  There would have to
be a way to go back and add points in the middle of the spline to make it
more accurate if necessary.  This makes the interface a bit tricky.  

After the spline is defined, the user would specify the number of men to
be placed along the curve.  The program would calculate arc lengths to
figure out where the men should be placed along the curves.

This kind of thing is done in the published corps-style charting software.
I wonder if we could get our hands on a copy and see how others have
solved the problem.  Again, this idea belongs on the back burner, so
there's no practical hurry to decide.  However, I like discussing anything
and everything under the sun.  It never hurts to think about things ahead
of time.

Martin and I considered this the holy grail of calchart programmers.  We
did come up with a pretty good solution, but we never bothered to
implement it because it was generally only used once a year for script cal.

The idea was to define a FTL continuity command.  Each man would be
assigned a "predecessor."  The man's continuity would be defined by DTP to
the originating location of the predecessor, then execute the
predecessor's continuity until the man reaches his own new spot.

This construction gives a recursively defined flow, but there is still the
problem of defining the line leader's continuity (the base case of the
recursion).  We didn't have a good idea for this, other than using MARCH
for straight segments and ROTATE for arcwise approximating curved paths.

Dan
--------------------

First I'll present some set theoretic preliminaries.

The power set of S is the collection of all subsets of S.  An atom is an
object which is NOT a set itself.  They are the "indivisible" elements of
whatever universe is under consideration.  A collection of sets is
finitely generated if the collection consists of sets of sets of sets ....
of sets of finitely many different atoms.

Axiom 1:  The atoms are the elements of R^2 x Z.

Axiom 1 is based on the assumption that the band essentially exists only
on the football field, and the field is clearly closely modelled by R^2
with rectangular coordinates.  Of course there are exceptions, such as
coming out of the stands, parachuting, and trap doors in the astroturf. 
However, the exceptions are unlikely enough for us to eliminate them from
consideration.

The factor of Z (the set of integers) allows for the possibility that finitely
many men may be at the same point on the field (e.g., shoulder pass).

Axiom 2:  Everything is discrete and finite.

Axiom 2 is based on the idea that the band consists of a finite number of
individual members.  Hence, the state of the marching band at any given
time can be described by a finite set of points on the field.

There is an important exception to this.  Although the band consists of
individual members, these points on the field are often meant to emulate a
continuous object such as a curve or a solid box.  For this reason,
corps-style programs generally have provisions for things like splines. 
Regardless, we're going to ignore this for now in order to be able to
actually draw some conclusions.

Theorem 1: Any show can be encoded as a finitely generated subcollection of
the power set of R^2.

Proof: Shows have a finite number of beats, and there are a finite number
of bandsmen.  So the collection of all points on the field occupied by any
bandsman at any time during the show is finite.  All other points are
irrelevant, so the subcollection, if it exists, is finitely generated by
this "totality of locations."

The state of any bandsman on a given stuntsheet can be described by some
pieces of information (label, symbol, continuity, position, associated
refpoints, etc.).  For each stuntsheet t and value of "information" I, define
S(t, I) = {pts on the field occupied on stuntsheet t by men possessing
"information" I on stuntsheet t}.  For example, S(16, SOLBKSL) = the set of
points p, which on ss 16 have a solid-back-slashman located at p.

Then the collection of S(t, I), where t and I run through all possible
values, is the desired subcollection. [endproof]

I do have a small concern about this kind of analysis.  Reducing things to
set theoretic concepts can result in a loss of useful algebraic structure.
The "forgetful functor" is the function that sends any object to it's
underlying set.  It is called forgetful because a lot of information is
lost in the transfer.  Here we aren't losing information because we are
NOT merely mapping to the underlying subset of R^2 x Z, but we may be
obscuring a potentially powerful algebraic point of view.  However, I
have not yet discovered such an algebraic point of view, so this is the
best model we have so far.

----------------

That's about all I have to say about formal theory.  Now the question is
what this really means in our practical situation.  The fundamental issue
is:  What is the most logical and useful way to store, present, and
manipulate the sets that define a show?  I leave the question of how the
program internally stores data to the programmers, who know much more
about this issue than I do.

In a limited sense, this set theoretic viewpoint really is useful.  In an
informal sense, shows are about different bandsmen doing different
things.  If not for this difference, then shows would just be a single block
moving around the field without changing shape.  For ease of comprehension
for the human mind, it is nice to group bandsmen into sections that are
doing the same thing at a particular time.  The memberships of these sets
changes over time - otherwise, a show would just be several different
blocks moving around the field without changing shape.  From this
perspective, it is clear how the set theory can be a useful construction.

I think we've already worked out most of the details of our interface.  We
know from several years of experience what kinds of things are useful,
what features are commonly used, what features are used but infrequently,
etc.  I'm planning on eventually getting around to writing down a list of
all the ideas that we've had so far.

---------------

After all considerations of user interface are answered, we are still left
with the fact that the program is doing nothing more than manipulating
sets.  Therefore, a "set theory menu" [I need a better name.  Any
suggestions?] that allows for ARBITRARY manipulation of sets will
necessarily provide the capability of doing absolutely anything that
exists under axioms 1 and 2.  By arbitrary manipulation, I mean that at
any time, a set with any given name containing any finite subset of R^2 x
Z can be created; and any existing set can be erased or edited to consist
of any finite subset of R^2 x Z; and the name of any set can be changed to
any other name. 

The manipulations provided on the set theory menu do not necessarily
have to be handy or intuitive.  The point here is the simple EXISTENCE of
the ability to do something, not the ease with which it is done.  All
questions of easiness should be addressed with the regular user interface.
The set theory menu is meant to be never actually used or used only
under the most bizarre of situations.

It will be a good idea to include many of the common set theoretic
operations and relationships on the set theory menu.  I have in mind such
operations as union, intersection, complement, symmetric difference (XOR),
possibly even power set.  Also, it would be convenient to define
relationships between different sets which cannot be broken unless the
user cancels the relationship.  For example, mutual exclusivity,
inclusion, or covering (require that the union of sets U1, ..., Un
contains set U).

Here is an example of a "bizarre" situation in which the set theory menu
could come in handy:  the show starts with half the bandsmen standing on
the shoulders of the other half - so there are only 72 men on each
stuntsheet.  12 stuntsheets later, the bandsmen on top jump off and start
marching on their own.  The animation of stuntsheet 13 to stuntsheet 14
calls for 72 points to become 144 points - each point "doubles."

Using the set theory menu, the user would be able to define the
"animation correspondence" sets (i.e., man at point (x,y) on SS9 marches
to point (w,z) on SS10) in such a way that each source (men on SS13) has
two destinations (men on SS14).  Then, the program would properly animate
the flow.

Note that I am NOT implying that this capability is actually useful.  I'm
just mentioning that it could conceivably be used by someone.

This complete freedom in defining sets will sometimes confuse the program.
It generally assumes that an animation correspondence set of point (x,y)
consists of a single point on the succeeding stuntsheet.  In the above
example, this is not the case.  Also, it generally assumes that each point
lies in exactly one continuity set.  In order to deal with these bizarre
situations, some conventions will have to be established.  For example,
continuity should probably be concatenated in some arbitrary order.

I'll put this on the list.

I've been working on a list describing everything we've talked about.  Or
as much as I can remember.  I've been making it very specific - assigning
particular keys to functions and so forth.  I've got separate files for a
list of key assignments and one listing all the features on the text menu.

As I review, I am thinking of lots of little things to be dealt with. 
When I send it to you, you should read it pretty carefully because it's
got some new things in it.

The list is becoming a very large document.  Actually, it's more like a
rough draft for the manual.

this is what I thought we had decided.  Left click to enter new data. 
Left drag to edit existing data.  Right click to delete data.  I've
decided that the "superposition" issue is not really a problem.  The
program will just choose one endpoint arbitrarily for deleting or editing.
Since there are only at most 3 data entries, this can never be terribly
inconvenient.

Individualmove and refpoints are more of a problem because it is possible
to stack many many men on top of each other.  When you click on a
superimposed man, then you choose from a menu listing all the labels.  An
option to permit the program to choose one at random?

I passed my Russian exam today.  I went to the professor, and he asked me
to start translating a Russian book into English.  "Theorem 1: The number
of irreducible pairwise nonequivalent representations is equal to the
number of conjugacy classes...."  At this point, he stopped me and said
that I passed.   Shortest exam I ever had.

I've run into a few problems while writing.  First, I don't think our idea
for the translation shortcut will work.  We had the idea that left
dragging immediately after defining a selected set would execute a
translation.  But left draggin immediately after selecting will cause
another rectangular selection.  So, I think we'll have to scrap the
shortcut idea.

Also, I am struggling over whether a group should be defined in terms of
points or in terms of men.  It might be nice to have groups where there
aren't men, but then what about when men are superimposed and you only want
some of the men to be assigned to the group?

I meant "arbitrarily" when I typed "random."  But it does not make the
slightest difference how the arbitrary rule is defined.  Here is what I
envision the "arbitrary" feature to be used for.  Let's say you've got a
bunch of points all stacked on top of each other, but you want to move
them into some formation.  You're going to have to move them one at a
time, but you don't really care what order you do them in.  You don't want
to have to hassle with a submenu for every single move, so you can "turn
it off."

Come to think of it, this scenario is fairly unlikely.  Smartmove would
probably work quite well here as long as the formation has straight lines,
so you wouldn't want to work in a completely arbitrary order.  Maybe we
should not bother with the arbitrary option.  Somehow I don't like the
idea of a list of default values that can be changed.

Here's what I've got so far.  The first file is the main text.  The next
two files are a list of keyboard meanings and a brief description of the
menu structure.  Best to view all three simultaneously on an Xterminal so
that you can follow along easier.

Note that this is totally incomplete; it's just what I've done so far, but
I think it takes care of all of the movement issues. I've made a lot of
arbitrary decisions, and they are definitely negotiable.

General

Arrow keys work just like moving the mouse, but the cursor stays on
the grid in this case.  There are some exceptions to this.  Left shift is
EXACTLY the same as the left mouse button.  Right shift is EXACTLY the
same as the right mouse button.  This means that the mouse is actually not
necessary for anything, since it can be simulated with SHIFT and arrow keys.
This will help reduce the number of things that have to go on the menu.

The screen has four sections.  Viewing region, icons, help/advice/warning
bar, and text menu.

The text menu can be accessed by either positioning the cursor on it and
clicking or by pressing ALT and then using arrows followed by RETURN to make a
choice.  All menu choices (e.g., choose direction of reflection) can be made
either with the mouse or with the arrow keys and RETURN.  TAB will cycle
through menu options.

Press
CTRL to access the icon bar.  Use arrow keys to select an icon, and then press
shift to select.

Clicking on a point with more than one man will cause a menu with a list of
labels of men at that point to appear.  Choose a man with the mouse or with
arrow keys and RETURN.  This applies to individualmove, individualblock,
smartmove, and clevermove.  ** Are there any other times when this feature
is needed?

ESC always aborts.  If a selected set existed, it still exists (except
when ESC is erasing an existing selection).  Not repeatable but is undoable.

U always undoes the last UNDOABLE action.  There is also an undo icon,
and there is an undo option on the menu.  Not repeatable.

R repeats last repeatable action.  Also an icon and a menu option. 
Aborted actions are never repeated in this or any other "repeat last" context.

S to save data to disk.  Also an icon and a menu option.  Default is save
under current name, but there is an option to change the name by typing
it.  If the show does not yet have a name, then this option is invoked
automatically.  Not undoable, not repeatable.

L to load a new show.  Also a menu option.  Asks to save the outgoing
show.  Asks for a name of new show, which can be typed or chosen from a
directory browser.  Not undoable, not repeatable.

Q to quit.  Also a menu option.  Prompts Y/N to really quit.  Obviously
not undoable.

Whenever a command makes no sense (repeatlastaction before any actions
have been executed, etc.), nothing happens but a warning on the warningn
bar.  If possible, a brief explanation is given.

Blocking

If a selected set currently exists, it is highlighted.  If a selected set
exists and the user implements another block command (EXCEPT for
individualblock), the original selected set will vanish and the new block
command will define a brand new one.  If the user holds O while
blocking, then the old selected set and the new one are ORed; if the user
holds X while blocking, then the old selected set and the new one are
XORed (EXCEPT for individualblock).

None are repeatable, and only individualblock is undoable.  Press ESC to
erase currently existing selected set.

Rectangularblock.  Press and hold the left button when the cursor is at p1. 
Move the cursor to p2.  All men within the NSEW rectangle with diagonally
opposite corners p1 and p2 are highlighted.  Release the left button to
select the highlighted men.  Boundary inclusive.

Lassoblock.  Press and hold the left button when the cursor is at p1. 
trace out a curve with the mouse to p2 - the curve appears onscreen as it is
defined.  All points within the region bounded by the curve and the segment
p1p2 are highlighted.  Release the right button to select the highlighted men.
Boundary inclusive.

Individualblock.  Place the cursor on an unselected man and click with the
right button.  The man is added to the selected set.  Place the cursor on
a selected man and click with the right button.  The man is subtracted
from the selected set.  If there is more than one man at the same
location, all are simultaneously added or subtracted.

Menublock.  Choose the menu item for blocking, and the program requests
the name of a group, which can be entered either by typing or by choosing
from a list.  Default only selects the local restriction of the group, but
global (or multiple SS) groups can be selected at will.  ** Do the other
forms of blocking need to be on the menu? 

Repeatlastblock.  Icon and menu item.  This is defined in terms of the men
who were selected, NOT by their locations when they were selected. 
Execution is immediate.

** Should there be a way to change the default to XOR or OR?

Individualmove

Place the cursor on a man.  click with the left button.  The man
disappears, and the shape of the cursor changes.  ** A target like in the
old version?  Move the cursor and click on another point.  The man reappears.

Geniusmove Family

Each is an icon and menu option.  Press RETURN before entering any new data
to recall the data from the most
recent action of the current type (i.e., translation data ONLY gets
applied to translation, not to other types).  If the user decides to recall
data after he has already input some new data, he should press ESC, then call
the action again and press RETURN immediately.

The advice bar displays the quantity and
type of information still required to uniquely determine the action.

If you try to input nonsensical data (e.g., two source points identical
with different destination points), the data will not be accepted and a
warning will appear.  If you try to input data when none more is required,
it will not be accepted and a warning will appear.

Click with the left to define a new source at the current cursor location p1. 
The shape of cursor changes.  Move the cursor to another point p2
(possibly p1 = p2).  A line appears from p1 to p2, and a dot appears at p2.
Click left again to set destination.

If the new data entry is identical (same source and destination) as an already
existing data entry, then it is completely ignored, and a warning message.

In some contexts, direction of motion is restricted.  After clicking on the
source, the freedom of motion of the cursor is restricted.
The displayed location of the cursor is the nearest "projection" of the mouse-
defined location onto an allowed direction.  ** I fear that I'm not explaining
this well.

To edit existing data, position the cursor over either a destination or a
source point.  Click and hold the left button.  Move the cursor and the
underlying point moves, too (the line changes simulateously).  Release the
left button, and the point is set at the current location of the cursor.
If more than one endpoint lies at the same location, then one of them will be
chosen arbitrarily when editing is invoked.  Note that if you try to edit a
fixed point, you might end up moving the source or the destination.  ** What is
the convention for choosing arbitrarily here?

To remove a data entry, click with the right on either endpoint.  Does NOT
request Y/N confirmation since the data entry is fairly easy to re-input.
See above paragraph when more than one endpoint lies at the same location.

Press RETURN to execute action with current data.  If the action is not well-
defined, then nothing will happen, but a warning message appears.

Translation.  G,T or icon or menu option.  Requires one data entry.

Shear.  G,S or icon or menu option.  Requires two data entries.  First data
entry is arbitrary, but direction must be cardinal.
Second entry must be parallel, and it cannot be colinear with the first data
entry.  If the line connecting
the two sources is perpendicular to the direction of motion and the lengths of
the new motions is the same, then the data is accepted, but a warning message
appears that this is actually going to be a translation, not a shear.

If the selected set of men is colinear, then it is possible for one properly
chosen data entry to define the action uniquely.  The data entry must lie on
the same line as all of the men.  In this case, a message appears that the
be cardinal).  

Reflection.  G,X or icon or menu option.  Choose one of four directions for
the axis of reflection from a menu
(must be cardinal).  One data entry required.  Direction of motion must be
perpendicular to axis of reflection.

Dilation.  G,D or icon or menu option.  Two data entries required. 
Directions of 
motion must be parallel.  Entries can be colinear.  If the line between source
points is perpendicular to the direction of motion, then the motions must be
of the same length.  In this case, there is a warning that the action will
actually be a translation, not a dilation.

If the set of selected men is colinear, then it is possible to define some
dilations with only one entry.  The source point must be colinear with the
selected set, and the direction of motion must be perpendicular to the line of
men.  In this case, a message appears that the action is already defined, but 
another data entry will be accepted.

Geniusmove.  G,G or icon or menu option.  Three data entries are required.

If the selected set is colinear, then it is possible to define the geniusmove
with only two entries.  Source points must be colinear with the selected set.

If the selected set lies entirely at a point, then it is possible to define
the geniusmove with only one entry.  The source point must coincide with the
location of the selected set.

In both cases, a warning message informs that the action is already
well-defined.  However, more data entries are accepted (up to the usual
maximum of three).

Rotation.  G,R or icon or menu option.  Rotation does not follow the convention
of the rest of the geniusmove family for data entry.  Locate the cursor at the
desired center of rotation and click with the left button.  A dot appears.
Remove the dot with right click, and move it with left drag.  Press RETURN
to execute.

Smartmove

Icon or menu option.  Not repeatable.  If two men have not been
individualmoved since the
program started running, the action will abort with a warning message.
Otherwise, a target appears at the next destination.  Right click on a man to
make him move to the target location.  Simultaneously, the target moves to the
next destination.  This process continues until ESC is pressed.  No other
actions are allowable until smartmove is aborted.

Undo before aborting smartmove will just undo the most recent move and will
return the target to its previous position.  Undo after aborting will undo
all movements caused during the entire smartmove.

Clevermove

Icon or menu option.  Not repeatable. 
If three men have not been individualmoved since the
program started running, then the action will abort with a warning message.
A target appears.  Right click on any man to move it to the position of the
target.  This continues until ESC is pressed; no other actions are allowed
until clevermove is aborted.

Undo before aborting will just undo the most recent move and will return the
target to its previous position.  Undo after aborting will undo the entire
clevermove.

Suppose that p1, p2, and p3 are the destinations of the three most recent
individualmoves in that order.  The target initially appears at
p1 + 2 (p2 - p1).  Each time the right button is pressed, the target is
incremented by (p2 - p1) automatically.  Right arrow (respectively left arrow)
manually increments (respectively decrements) the location of the target by
p2 - p1.  Up arrow (down arrow) manually increments (decrements) the location
of the target by p3 - p1.  Press the left mouse button to move the target to
p1 + (n+1) (p3 - p1), when the target was at p1 + m (p2 - p1) + n (p3 - p1).

Note that the meaning of the arrows has nothing to do with the relative
position of p1, p2, and p3.  Therefore, it is most logical to start in the
lower left corner of a block.  If the user starts in the upper right corner,
then down arrow will move the target up and right arrow will move the target
left.

In the interests of "unification," I've been trying to reduce the concept
of "stuntsheet" and of "reference pt" into an expression of a certain
relationship of groups.  For this, I've been tinkering slightly with our
definition of group, but I don't quite have it right yet.  However, I'm
getting closer and closer, and I have a feeling that soon it will all
become crystal-clear.  I want to figure this out before I write any more
of the outline, so that's why I've stalled recently.

The really cool thing about reducing a stuntsheet to the level of any
other group is that all of the moving routines that we've designed will
then be applicable in a natural way to other groups.  This is already the
case with refpts, but I want to generalize, just to see where it will take us.

[Al: Thought you might like the "abstractness" of this discussion.]


Ok, I think I've FINALLY gotten it.  I was having trouble dealing with the
fact that labels consisted of one man from each stuntsheet.  This seemed to
make it impossible for stuntsheets and labels to be fundamentally the same
thing, and I couldn't figure out how to get around this problem.

Then I discovered the answer.  They are NOT the same.  The new construction
essentially belongs to "category theory," to put things in abstract
mathematical terms.  I am under the impression that intelligent languages
like C++ can deal quite nicely with these kinds of structures, but I'm not
at all sure of that.

Anyway, here's a description with concrete examples.  If you don't understand,
just ask for clarification.


A group is a set of points with multiplicity.  For example, stuntsheets and
reference point sheets are groups.  A subgroup is a subset of the set of
points.

A Group G is a collection of groups: one subgroup G(g) (possibly empty) for
each group g of the show.  For example, symbols are Groups, and so are labels.

A subGroup H of G is a Group such that for all g, H(g) is contained in G(g).
For example, "all solidmen on SS4-7" (call it H) is a subGroup of Solidman
since H(SSn) = Solidman(SSn) for n = 4,5,6,7, and H(g) = empty set for all
other groups.  In fact, H is a special kind of subGroup called a restriction
subGroup (my term, not mathematically standard).  A restriction subGroup H of
G is a subGroup such that for each g, H(g) = G(g) or H(g) = empty set.
Basically, H is the restriction of G to only SOME stuntsheets (groups).
Generally speaking, projection subGroups will be the most common type of
real application - this is the
analogous concept to our old idea of global and local groups.

A GGroup GG is a collection of Groups: for each Group G of the show,
GG(G) is a subGroup of G.  Here is an example of such a thing.  Suppose
that the band is split into four long lines, and each line is doing its own
follow-the-leader drill that extends for several stuntsheets.  Note that
the line leader is not necessarily the same for all sheets - the direction
of following could reverse, or the line could snake into a block and then
snake out of the block in a different way, etc.  There could even be more
than one line leader on any given SS.

The four lines make four separate Groups (A, B, C, D).  Note that they cannot
be realized as groups since they extend over several sheets.

Now A(SSn) is a group, and it has a (usually singleton, but not necessarily)
subgroup LineleaderA(SSn) consisting of the line-leader(s) for the flow of
line A on SSn.  So, LineleaderA is a subGroup of A.

Set LLineleader(A) = LineleaderA (and similarly for B, C, D).  Then 
LLineleader is a GGroup.  It consists of all of the lineleaders on all of the
stuntsheets.

One could also define Lineleader(SSn) to be all of the lineleaders of all
four lines on SSn.  Then Lineleader would be a Group, not a GGroup, and it
also consists of all of the lineleaders on all of the stuntsheets.  However,
there is a difference between Lineleader and LLineleader.  The difference
is that LLineleader remembers that certain lineleaders belong to the same
line, whereas Lineleader cannot distinguish between leaders of line B and
leaders of line A.

So, what's the point?  Let's say that A, B, C, and D are noted by the symbols
plain, X, slash, and bkslh respectively.  We want to mark all lineleaders 
with the corresponding solid symbol (solid, solidX, etc.).  This change could
be caused all at once with LLineleader.

Note that Lineleader would be sufficient if all we wanted to do was change
all lineleaders (regardless of which line) to solidmen, which is the way that
stuntsheets are usually done.




As another more abstract example, the collection of all restriction subGroups
of G is a GGroup GG:  GG(H) = H if H is a restriction subGroup of G, and
GG(H) = empty set otherwise.  

Speaking abstractly, we always assume that every possible group or Group or
GGroup does in fact exist.  However, this is obviously not the case in our
situation with a machine with finite amounts of memory.  So, the example
directly above gives the full collection of restriction subGroups in the
abstract sense, but in actuality, GG would only be the collection of those
restriction subGroups that actually had been already defined by the user.


Note that there is no reason to stop at the second level.  G^3roups are
perfectly well-defined, as are G^nroups for any positive integer n.  However,
as n increases, G^nroups are less and less likely to be actually useful.

Now I've got to adapt this abstract construction to our real problem.  I'll
keep you posted.

There's a decent amount of new material buried in here, so read carefully.
As I progress, I've been changing around the keystrokes, so they won't be
consistent with the other material I've sent you.  No big deal - we can
straighten that out that small point later.

Roy used the phrase "gone ballistic" to describe my recent behavior towards

------------------------------


Stuntsheet Manipulation

The ordering of stuntsheets is an artificial construction that eases usage,
but it is not fundamental from the group viewpoint.

Nextsheet.  N or icon or menu option.  If the current sheet is last, prompt
to insert new sheet at the end.

Previoussheet.  P or S,P or
icon or menu option.  If the current sheet is first,
prompt to insert new sheet at the beginning.

Goto.  G or S,G or icon or menu option.  Submenu showing all stuntsheets.
Option for showing all groups.
Type name (group names accepted) or select from list.

Removesheets.  S,R or menu option.  Submenu showing all stuntsheets.
Option for showing all
groups.  Type or select as many sheets as desired (groups accepted).  Y/N
prompt to REALLY remove sheets.

Insertsheet.  I or S,I or icon or menu option.  To choose sheet after which
insertion is to take place, submenu listing all stuntsheets.  Option to insert
before first stuntsheet.  Default is current stuntsheet.  Group names not
accepted.

To choose initial configuration, submenu listing all stuntsheets.  Option
to list all groups.  Default is current stuntsheet.  Group names accepted.

To choose name, type.  Default is the logical numerical choice, if one exists.
"Logical" numbers consist of
a number followed by a letter (e.g., 15, 35A, 16N).  If the nearby sheets
are not numbered logically, then there is no default.

If insert after last stuntsheet numbered 32 (or 32A), then default is 33.
If insert before first stuntsheet numbered 1 or 0 or 3A, then default is
0 or -1 or 3 respectively.  If insert between consecutive sheets 15 and
18, then default is 16.  If insert between consecutive sheets 15 and 16,
then default is 15A.  If insert between consecutive sheets 15A and 16, then
default is 15B.  If insert between consecutive sheets 16 and 15, then there
is no default.

Movesheets.  S,M or menu
option.  To choose stuntsheets to be moved, submenu listing
all stuntsheets.  Type or select from menu (groups not accepted).  To choose
stuntsheet after which selected sheets will be moved, submenu listing all
stuntsheets (groups not accepted).  Option for moving to the very beginning.
Default is current stuntsheet.

Effect of execution is best described by example.  Suppose that sheets 2, 4,
and 5 have been selected, and the destination is after SS7.  Then the new
order will be 1, 3, 6, 7, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Copysheet.  S,C or menu option.  To choose sheet to be changed, submenu listing
all stuntsheets.  Option to list all groups.  Default is current stuntsheet.
Type or select from menu (groups
accepted).  To choose sheet to be copied, submenu listing all stuntsheets.
Option to list all groups.  Default is preceding sheet to current stuntsheet,
if it exists.  Otherwise, succeeding sheet if it exists.  Otherwise, no
default.

Name.  S,N or menu option.  To choose sheet to be renamed, submenu listing
all stuntsheets.  Default is current stuntsheet.  Option to list all groups
(groups are accepted).  Type new name for stuntsheet.

Autoname.  S,A or menu option.  Rename all stuntsheets so that they are in
increasing numerical order.  All associated refptsheets, etc. are
simultaneously changed.

Reference Points

Each stuntsheet is associated to arbitrarily many refptsheets.  The names for
these refptsheets are sRn, where s is the name of the stuntsheet and n is the
number of the refptsheet.  For example, the third refptsheet of SS13 is 13R3.
By convention, 13 is synonymous with 13R0.
Of course, these names can be changed, and associations can be changed.
Associations are an artificial construction to ease usage and are not
essential from the perspective of groups.

Selectrefpt.  R,S or icon or menu option.  Submenu listing all refptsheets
associated to the current stuntsheet that are not identical to the current
stuntsheet, plus the associated refptsheet with the SMALLEST number that IS
identical to the current stuntsheet.  [** Latter is for making "new" 
refptsheets; perhaps some special annotation on the list.  Or maybe there
should be an Insertrefpt command.]
If stuntsheet s is onscreen, then default is sR1.  If sRn is

Oh, yeah, I remember now.  Do you think that this will be too confusing
for the user?  Left click usually means individualmove, but if a selected
set exists, then it means translation.  I guess that's OK; I'll write it in
to the outline.

Good.  This is exactly the kind of thing about which I was hoping you
would know more than me.  You've got some background experience with other
interfaces that helps out.

I definitely agree that X and O are bad choices, but I couldn't think of
anything else.

I kind of like the idea that the program could run fully functionally
without the mouse.  One of these years, the band is probably going to get
a laptop.  Imagine we're in Pasadena rehearsing for the Rose Bowl, and
stunt realizes that there is a major mistake on one of the sheets.  They
could make new stuntsheets that evening on the laptop, print them at
Kinko's, and distribute them the next morning.  So, it might end up being
very useful to have some independence from specific pieces of hardware.

However, I respect the fact that you've got to write the actual code, so
our final decision should chiefly depend on what you think is feasible.

What about having the arrow keys simulate mouse movement?  Is that
reasonable?  The user could use the arrow keys together with the keyboard
commands to do just about anything, albeit slowly and painfully.

Keyboard browsing the menus and icon lists can be ditched without much loss of
functionality.  Remember that I've got the "kitchen sink" attitude in
writing this outline.  Anything that has the slightest chance of being
included should be discussed first.

Reducing things to groups and Groups and GGroups is my "program."  This

In my section of refpts, I treated refptsheets entirely like any other
group.  Note that the specific refpt commands can usually be applied to
any sort of group.  The exception are things like Associate, which don't
make sense in general.

Onionskin will be based upon showing more than one group at a time, so it

You are definitely on to something.  It sounds like you are starting to
understand my abstract mumbo-jumbo.  I haven't gotten to the continuity
writing part yet, so I haven't worked out the precise conventions yet. 
However, it will certainly be possible to refer to any group at any time.

I have been trying to deal with this problem by having reasonable default
values.  Initially, submenus only show the most likely choices, but more

I think that you are essentially distinguishing between groups and Groups,
but I'm not sure.  The one-to-one correspondence that you are talking
about is really the labeling.  More generally, groups do not have to be
the same size; they are just arbitrary sets of points.  Label Groups set
up the correspondence between different sheets.

There really is a very common application of the ability to have groups of
different sizes.  Consider the tunnel flow and scriptcal flow sheets in 
pregame.  Currently we have to move the undesired points into the corner
and then use whiteout on the printed sheet.  With the new version, we
could just delete the undesired men from those stuntsheets - no problem at
all.

I am trying to write the interface so that it can be used by people with
different levels of understanding.  Essentially, the idea is that if you
haven't heard of a term or don't know about a feature, then just ignore
it.  Things like refpts can be done entirely with the group commands, but
there are also specific refpt commands that are basically redundant copies
of the corresponding group commands.  This way, people who understand
refpts but not groups can work easily.

I'm a little bit concerned that you haven't fully understood my
group/Group/GGroup ideas.  Maybe it's just that you haven't read those
letters yet.  Anyway, this concept is pretty fundamental to everything
that I'm doing now, so I'll reexplain it if necessary.

Sorry for overwhelming you with text.  Take your time with it; there's no
hurry.  After all, our agenda is entirely set by the rate at which you work.
Just because I don't have enough to do doesn't mean that you should have
to work faster.

I'm going to retreat slightly from my completely abstract constructions. 
I fully realize that all that nonsense is not necessary or even desirable
in the actual program.  This is my opinion on what the program really should
do.

I've been having trouble making logical sense of many concepts without the
natural ordering of stuntsheets.  In particular, this is causing
difficulty with animation and with relabeling.  Anyway, I don't think that
animation can be described in any nice way strictly with unordered groups.

So, the concept of "ordering" becomes a fundamental idea - not just an
artificial construction for the convenience of the user.  This makes
fairly little difference in the actual coding, but it changes the way that
we as users should think about things and therefore will influence the
logic of the user interface.

However, it would be nice to bend the rules of strict linear animation
from time to time.  In particular, I'm thinking about flow sheets for a
complicated flow (e.g., script cal).  So, we allow for stuntsheets to be
"simultaneous" within the ordering of the show.  For example, sheets 12C,
12A, and 12L would all occur at the same time.  In real life, these sheets
DO occur at the same time - now the program will understand that idea. 
This seems like a good idea if for no other reason than that it reflects
reality.

This would not affect nextsheet or previoussheet; if you're on 12C and you
press N, you'll go to 12A, not 13.  I'm not certain yet how it would
affect relabeling - I'll have to think about that.  Basically, the only
difference it would really make is in animation.

--------------

On groups and Groups and GGroups.  Only groups and Groups have the
slightest chance of being useful, so lets throw away G^nroups for n
greater than or equal to 2.  For clarity of description, a Group from now
on will be called a "collection."  Now we won't have to depend on capital
letters; however, I will continue to use capital letters at the beginning
of the names of collections for clarity.  The term "collection" is
supposed to reflect the fact that it is a collection of subgroups.

Well, I was planning on allowing the user to be able to refer to locations
on any group, but that's not the real problem.  This is the issue I'm
trying to deal with.  When the program finishes animating stuntsheet 13,
what does it do next?  Of course, it should animate stuntsheet 14, but how
does the program know that?  Because it follows the "ordering" of
stuntsheets when it works its way through the show.

I want to be able to animate SS 12C, 12A, and 12L simultaneously.

Got to go, but I'll write more later.

I was discussing earlier the advantages of having a stuntsheet that would
not be part of the animation.  It would still be part of the order, so this
would mean that Nextsheet and
Previoussheet would access this group, and one could still associate refpt
sheets to it, and so forth.
 
I guess we will need two orders - one for animation, and one for all other
purposes.  We can allow simultaneous stuntsheets in the animation order,
and we can also allow some stuntsheets to not even appear in the animation
order.

Load the program.  Type F,L.  Type the name of the show you want.  Type A.
Use arrow keys to move forward and back through the animation.  Press ESC.
Type F,Q.


We haven't discussed new features for the continuity editor or for the
animation subroutine.  I was thinking that the parser should check for
proper grammar as soon as you exit the text editor, rather than waiting
until you try to animate.  Should we allow basic cut/paste actions?

How about an auto-animate?  You press a button, and the show moves through
all of the animation at a prespecified rate.  Prevents your finger from
getting tired clicking the mouse so much.

Suppose that we define 12C, 12A, and 12L to be simultaneous, and suppose
that label A4 appears on both 12C and 12A.  When animated, the point for A4
will split into two - one will go to its destination on 12C and one will go
to its destination on 12A.  The points will merge again when they reach
stuntsheet 13.  Does this answer your question?  I have a feeling that this
is not actually what you asked.

But how will this be implemented?  I can imagine a text window replacing the
old editing screen, but how will it be possible to edit 8 sets of text
simultaneously in any reasonable fashion?

With respect to collections, simultaneously editing continuity would be
fine.  Remember that each section of each collection has a body of text linked
to it.  Simultaneous editing would just mean that all the text that is linked
to the section of any collection will appear at once.

I'm not really clear on what you are trying to say here, so please elucidate.

How about controllable on the fly?  Keys 1-9 for speed and +/- to
determine direction.  Or a sliding scale onscreen for speed and two icons
for direction.

Oh, I see what you are worrying about.  You are basically concerned about
what happens when there are stuntsheets with varying numbers of points.  I
haven't sent this to you yet, but I've designed a command that adds points
to groups, and another command that deletes points from groups.  In order
to move A4 from 12A to 12C, you'd have to delete it on 12A and add it on 12C.
Then, you'd have to assign it a label.  This is pretty cumbersome as it
stands, so maybe we'll make a shortcut if we think that this will be a fairly
common activity: something like "Movepoint."

Despite all of this, I think that there is a better way to deal with the
specific example of 12C, 12A, and 12L.  Define three separate collections
C, A, and L, where C(12) are the men in the Cflow, A(12) are the men in the
Aflow, and L(12) are the men in the Lflow.  Then it is easy to move A4
from one collection to another; just delete it from C(12) and add it to A(12).
I've already designed commands to allow for this kind of thing.

In order to print the separate flowsheets, we will enable the print routine
to print specific collections.  Actually, if you think about it, the print
routine already works this way.  It's just that there is no choice in the
collection - it is always Show.

By doing things in this way, I think that we will avoid just about all
circumstances when it will be necessary to move a man A4 from one
stuntsheet to another.

OK, whatever you think is best.  The only that's really important to me is 
that we think of the text as being associated to the COLLECTION, not just the
stuntsheet.  This is quite important to the way that I would like to deal
with special continuity assignments.

Now we're getting somewhere!  All of your ideas sound good.  So, there are
two ways to view animation: manual and automatic.  For automatic, there
are three ways to adjust speed: keyboard (1-9, +, -), VCR style (icons and
scales), and bpm.  Even in automatic, it should be possible to jump around
to different stuntsheets.

Won't processors of varying power affect the bpm?  Or maybe you know how
to deal with that problem.  Come to think of it, I'm sure you do.  We're
not the first people ever to design a time-dependent application.

This afternoon I wrote an 8K document (160 lines) that I call the
"Calchart Version 3 Primer." It explains all of the new abstract concepts
in great detail with lots of examples.  I will send it to you, and I will
also send a copy to Erin.  The two of you should distribute it to a few
stuntmembers and other Calchart users (Hack, Trevor, Pearson).  It
is important to know whether anyone else will be able to understand our
ideas before we bother to write the program, and the only way we can find
out is by trying to explain it to someone else.  Please gather feedback
and let me know what the general opinion is.

Calchart v3 Introduction

Version 3 will have essentially the same capabilities as version 2.  However,
the user interface has been completely restructured to facilitate use.
Also, many new features have been added, but they are mostly nothing more
than shortcuts for common tasks.  To fully understand the logic of the new
interface, it is necessary to grasp a few new abstract concepts.

Underlined words are definitions.  Any defined word is always used in the
literal technical sense.  The list of defined words is: group, collection,
section, order, animation order, associate, current group, and current
stuntsheet.

Groups

A _group_ is a collection of points on the field counting multiplicity.
"Counting multiplicity" means that more than one point can occupy an identical
location on the field without causing any ambiguities.  Other than location,
there is no additional data associated with each point.  Information about
label, symbol, and continuity instructions are stored elsewhere.

Stuntsheets and refptsheets are by far the most common examples of groups.
In fact, it is very uncommon for any other kind of group to be necessary.
However, it occasionally does happen; in these situations, it is best to
solicit the help of an "expert." (Dan Isaksen, Gurk Meeker, et al.)  For most
practical purposes, there is no danger in mentally limiting the concept
of group to apply only to stuntsheets and refptsheets.

The group consisting of the men on stuntsheet 13 will be simply denoted as 
"13," and "15R2" will denote the second refptsheet for stuntsheet 15.

Collections

A _collection_ C is a bunch of sets of points.  For each group g, there is a
set of points C(g) which is a subset of g.  Recall that g itself is a set
of points, so it makes sense to call C(g) a subset of g.  C(g) is called the
_section_ of C associated to g.  The term "section" is not meant to reflect
the idea of an instrument section such as mellophones.

Symbols are actually collections.  For example, for each stuntsheet N,
let Plain(N) be the set of men on stuntsheet N that are plainmen.  For
example, Plain(13) is the set of all men that appear as plainmen on
stuntsheet 13.  Observe that Plain(13) is a subset of the set of points of
the group "stuntsheet 13".  Therefore, Plain is a collection whose sections
correspond to those men that appear as plainmen on each stuntsheet.

Strictly speaking, Plain is also defined for all refptsheets and all other
groups.  However, the value of Plain(13R1) is generally inconsequential
since it will not be printed anyway.

Note that it is perfectly reasonable
for a section of Plain (or of any other collection) to be the empty set for
some or all groups.  This empty set situation actually occurs when a
particular symbol, say Solidbackslash, is not used on a particular stuntsheet,
say 9.  In this case, Solidbackslash(9) is the empty set.

Generally speaking, each point of a group lies in exactly one section of
one of the symbol collections.  This means that each man has exactly one and
only one symbol on any given stuntsheet.  However, this does not have to be
the case, and the program has the capability of assigning more than one
symbol to a man by allowing the sections of different symbols to overlap on
a particular group.  Moreover, it is possible for a man to have no symbol at
all by allowing a point of a group to lie in no section of any symbol group.

Labels are another example of collections.  Usually, each section of a label
collection consists of exactly one point.  For example, 69(5) is the point
that is labelled 69 on stuntsheet 5, and B0(20R3) is the third reference
point of man B0 on stuntsheet 20.

As in the case of symbols, each point of a group generally lies in one and
only one section of a label collection.  However, this does not have to be
the case.  As above, it is perfectly reasonable (although of doubtful use)
to have a man with more than one label or to have a man without any label
at all.

Yet another common example of collections consists of special continuity
assignment.  From time to time, a flow (say on stuntsheet 34)
is designed that can be explained
easily to humans but is hard to explain to the program.  So, specific
continuity instructions must be given to small sets of men.  These sets
are defined by making them the sections corresponding to group 34 of
special user-created collections (call one Special).  Generally speaking,
Special(n) will be empty for all n other than 34, but the specific value
of Special(33) is not consequential since it will never be referred to.
However, clever users will realize that there are times when it is quite
effective to use Special as a meaningful collection on more than one
stuntsheet.

User-defined collections are particularly helpful in tracking particular
bodies of bandsmen throughout a show.  For example, it may be helpful to
see the basses section or the percussion section highlighted in a special
color during animation.  In order to do this, the user must define a
collection (Basses) such that Basses(n) is equal to the men on stuntsheet n
that are bass players.  The Basses collection can be fairly easily created
using the tools for collection manipulation provided by the program; it is
not necessary to define each section on each group by hand.  Now, the
user can select the Basses collection to be highlighted during animation.

Orders

The _order_ of a show is a sequence of some of the groups of a show.  Note
that the order does not necessarily contain all groups.  A _stuntsheet_
is a group that appears in the order.  All other groups (such as refpt
sheets) are NOT stuntsheets and do not appear in the order.

The order is used by several aspects of the program.  When the user selects
Nextsheet or Previoussheet, the program follows the order to determine
which group is actually next or previous.  The order can be changed with
the Movesheets command.

Stuntsheets are considered by the program to be
the "most important" groups.  For example, when the user selects Goto, a
list of groups will appear, from which the user must choose the new group to
be edited.  Initially, the program only lists the names of stuntsheets
because it is most likely that the user will want to go to a stuntsheet.
However, it is possible to see a list of all groups on request.

The _animation_order_ is also a sequence of some of the groups of a show, but
it is somewhat independent of the order.  Only stuntsheets (as defined by
being members of the order) can be members of the animation order.

Most often, the animation order will be identical to the order, but this 
does not have to be the case.  For example, sometimes a flow is created that
is easily explainable to the program but is difficult to describe to human
marchers.  So, intermediate flowsheets are created to facilitate
interpretation by bandsmen.  However, the intermediate flowsheets do not
really belong in the animation, so they can be removed from the animation
order.

As described in the example, it is possible for some stuntsheet not to 
appear anywhere in the animation order.  It is also possible for stuntsheets
to occur simultaneously in the animation order.  This has the effect of
superimposing more than one flow on the screen.

Associations

Each sheet of reference points is meant to be used in connection with a
particular stuntsheet.  This is reflected in the nomenclature: 12R1 is a
refptsheet tied to stuntsheet 12.

Any group can be _associated_ to a particular stuntsheet (as usual,
here "stuntsheet" means
a member of the order).  Generally speaking, each refptsheet is associated
to one stuntsheet in a natural way.  It is very uncommon to need any other
kind of association.  However, it is possible to associate an arbitrary
group to an arbitrary stuntsheet, regardless of name.

It is possible for a group to be associated to no stuntsheet.  For example,
a user-defined group (not a stuntsheet or a refptsheet) is generally 
unassociated.  Of course, it is possible for more than one group to be
associated to the same stuntsheet; in other words, it is possible for a
stuntsheet to have more than one set of reference points.
It is even possible (although of doubtful use) for
a single group to be associated to more than one stuntsheet.

The program uses associations as a way of trying to predict what information
the user is most likely to need at any given time.
For example, when the user chooses
onionskin, a list of groups appears.  The user must choose a group, which
then will appear in the "background" of the viewscreen.  Initially, the
list displays only the associated groups to the current stuntsheet because
these groups are most likely to be wanted by the user.  However, it is
possible to see the full list of groups if desired.

Current groups

At any given time, there is one particular group that is _current_.  It is
the group that is being displayed onscreen.  Most commands such as
individualmove, clevermove, geniusmove, labelflip, or symbolchange will
always be applied only to the current group.

The current group is often
used by the program in predicting a default value.  For example, if the
users selects Removegroup, a list of groups will appear.  The user must
choose the name of a group that will be erased.  If the user does not
actively choose a name, the the program will assume that the user wants
to erase the current group.

If the current group is associated to some stuntsheet, then this stuntsheet
is the _current_stuntsheet_.  For example, if the user is editing the
fourth reference point for stuntsheet 19, then the current group is 13R4,
and the current stuntsheet is 13.  If the current group is unassociated,
then there is no current stuntsheet.

Like the current group and associated groups, the current stuntsheet is used by
the program to predict what information the user is likely to need at any
given time.

Last night I dreamed about calchart.  Minutes of time were like points, and
dreams were the equivalent of groups.  I guess I really have gone ballistic.

I've got a few new ideas.  After writing about orders yesterday, I thought
of a new way to handle nextsheet, previoussheet, movesheet, copysheet,
removesheet, etc.  The user selects "Order," and a vertical listing of all
stuntsheets appears (in the sequence representing the order).  To the side
of the list are a bunch of options: goto, copy, move, insert, delete, etc.
This makes manipulation of stuntsheets much more intuitive since you can
think of it pictorially as adjusting the stack of sheets listed onscreen.
The user can make as many changes as he wants and then presses ESC to abort.

If this sounds good to you, I'll rewrite that section of the outline.

Also, I've been thinking more about what we talked about with how to type
continuity instructions.  The goal really is to allow the user to view
more than one set of continuity instructions simultaneously.  I don't
think that your solution will really accomplish that very well since the
user will still have to scroll up and down.  Besides, it's just so ugly to
have a single text file with special codes to separate the different sets
of instructions.

How about splitting a window vertically (or horizontally) so that the user can
edit two sets of continuity simultaneously?  I don't think there's much
need for more than two, but we could allow the user to request more splits
in order to view more than two continuities at once.  Then, we can keep
each set of continuity as a separate body of text, but it will be easy to
go back and forth between them.

I read the thing you gave me and I sort of understand the therminology 
that he presented.  So did he already write the prgram or what?  I don't 
know what he wrote all this stuff for.  Is he asking for suggestions, or 
something?  Cuz all he wrote was a dictionary of terms.

I do have a suggestion maybe we can find a way to change the program 
commands on calchart so that it mirrors our continuity on the stunt 
sheets better.  You know, instead of typing ewns to np mtrm e we could 
right FMHS EW/NS to S.S.14 [MTHS E].  This would require changing the 
code of the program i think.  If you can do this you can connect the 
commands on the stunt sheet to print out instead of haveing to retype the 
comtinuity on a different editor and stuff.  This is just icing on the 
cake though.  I think that the first thing that should be worked on is 
the perspective of the animation on calchart.  Instead of a blimps 
perspective, a tilted field would be better.

I'm not a computer programmer, but I remember you can make sub programms 
that can connect two things.  I'm pretty sure that's how the continuity 
is placed from the editor to the stuntsheets now I think.  If this is so 
you could write a subroutine that will look for key phrases in the old 
stuntsheets and equate it to print out something else.  Like for instance 
You could get the program to recognize EWNS TO NP
				       MTRM E   	in the calchart 
programm and then have it print out FMHS EW/NS TO S.S.$(this could be the 
stunt sheet name which is usually in sequential order) [MTHS E].  This 
could be defeating the purpose of having to enter continuity in one 
language.  But it would prevent us from typing two versions of the same 
continuity.  If we can link the two that way it would be easier.  Most of 
our continuity follows the same set of patterns. 
	step (x y rz) e --- typed out as:
			    Execute Step x as per arrows
			    Drill:
				continuity
			    [MTHS E BEFORE AND AFTER]

I think things like this could be recognized and translated by a 
subroutine of some sort.  I remember doing this in fortran and in pascal 
in high school.  these are pretty old programs now but I'm sure the newer 
ones can still do this if not better or quicker.

Yeah, I should have known that no one else would really care.  The only
reason you care is that you are writing the program.  The only reason I
care is that I don't have a life in Chicago, so I have nothing better to
do with my free time than type detailed essays into the computer.

This is somewhat related to something that I wanted to tell you.  I made a
bad mistake during my time as Calchart guru.  I failed to inspire anyone
else to get involved.  Martin dragged me in, and I carried the torch for a
number of years.  Fortunately, you got involved on your own accord just
when you were needed.  It really is important to have at least one person
around who REALLY knows what he is doing because as long as humans are
running the band, there will always be emergencies.

Part of the reason that I never chose a protege was that I was so quick
with the program that the prospect of training someone else seemed so
tedious and slow.  Anyway, I urge to find someone who is interested, and
teach that person everything you know before you leave.  Sure, we can
write a manual, but no one is ever going to read it.

One thing that I think is particularly cool is the fact that you, Martin,
and me are all mello players.  I encourage you to find another mello player.

I admit that I have not given the slightest concern to issues of practical
computing in my thinking.  I don't know enough about that subject to have
a worthwhile opinion.  So I'll trust you to tell me when something just
isn't feasible.  However, I hope you'll give all ideas a fair chance and
make an honest effort to find a way to implement them.

If Calchart is ever actually used in an X environment, it would probably
be very convenient to allow the same show to be simultaneously viewed in
more than one window.  You could view one stuntsheet while editing
another, etc.

Anyway, this will cause obvious problems with file-locking, so maybe you
should install a command line option for read-only.  This would still
allow the user to view different stuntsheets simultaneously.

Come to think of it, read-only is also a good idea for random idiots who
want to look at the animation.  They wouldn't have to worry about
accidentally messing something up.

I've been thinking about your concern over efficiently recalling symbols.
I'll let you know my ideas when they are a little more coherent.

The ratio of complication to usefulness of the animation order concept is
too high.  Let's just chuck that whole idea.  The animation routine uses
the regular stuntsheet order to determine animation.

It will be impossible to do the "jump off the shoulders of the bandsman"
flow, but I don't think that is a major problem.  :)

If you want to have a stuntsheet but you don't want it to appear in the
animation, then make it into a group.  Or if the unanimated stuntsheeet is
a subsheet (like 12C, 12A, 12L in scriptcal), then make it a collection.
You can still print it out since the print routine will be generalized to
allow for arbitrary groups and collections.

This may seem an awkward way to avoid animating unwanted sheets, so most
people are not going to know how to do this.  However, that's no big loss
We've been dealing with the problem for years, and it hasn't caused a
crisis yet.  But the real calchart pros will be able to make their
animation look much slicker by using this trick.

Just have a prompt for saving when the user quits.  This is a pretty
standard feature on word processors and text editors.

I had discarded the notion of collections and groups with respect to
animation, but this is a good idea.  I know that this makes your
job a little harder, but how about having an Animation collection?  Each
section of this collection represents the men that will be displayed on
that stuntsheet.  If you don't want a stuntsheet to appear in the
animation at all, then make its section empty.  

If you only want one part of a flow to be animated, just set the section
to be the men that you want.  This could be a useful tool in analyzing
flows.  It is essentially like highlighting men in the animation, except
that rather than making the men orange to stand out, you make them invisible.

There's no great urgency on the stuntsheet that I asked for.  I've got to
get some photographs developed before I can mail anything, so it will be
at least a few days before I will need it.

Great!  I'd love to see what you've done.  Isn't it kind of late to still
be printing spring show sheets?  Rehearsals start this week, don't they?

At first glance, here are the changes that I think we should make to the
continuity language.

1) Refer to arbitrarily labelled points of arbitrary groups: P(<label>
<group>) is the position of man <label> on group <group>.  Change current
point to CP to avoid ambiguity.  Note that this function has the same value
for all men.

POS(<group>) returns the position of the man under consideration on group
<group>.  Unlike P, POS takes on different values for different men. 

POS is an abbreviation of "position," and P is an abbreviation for "point".

2) Stepsize GV = 1.

3) Fountain takes a stepsize parameter.

4) COMPASS(<point>) returns nearest compass direction (N, S, E, W, NE, NW,
SE, or SW) from CP to <point>.  COMPASSFROM(<point1> <point2>) analogously.

CARDINAL(<point>) returns nearest cardinal direction (N, S, E, or W) from CP
to <point>.  CARDINALFROM(<point1> <point2>) analogously.  Note that this
is a slightly different definition of "cardinal" than the one that we have
been using in our discussions.  "Compass" is equivalent to our old meaning
for "cardinal."  There is a small obvious problem with using the term
"CARDINAL" (ie, stanford).

These functions operate similarly to EITHER.

5) GRAPEVINE <stepsize> <steps> <direction1> <direction2> is the obvious
thing.  Direction1 is the direction of travel; direction2 is the direction
which bandsmen are facing.

FMGV <steps> <direction1> <direction2>.  Same as above, but assumes that
stepsize is 1.

FMGVTO <direction> <destination>.  Obvious.  If direction of travel is NE,
SW, NW, or SW, then stepsize is DM; otherwise, stepsize is GV.

-----------

It may seem that the grapevine commands are irrelevant, but they are going
to become much more important when a nice 3d animation viewer is installed.
Might as well plan ahead and install them now.  I would definitely use
them, but lazy stuntmembers won't bother to do the extra typing and
thinking necessary.

Erin suggested trying to unify the continuity language with the standard
abbreviations used in writing continuity instructions for bandsmen.  Maybe
it would make more sense to change the standard abbreviations to match
Calchart's language?  I fear that this would only increase the
mathematization of charting.  I can easily envision stuntmembers with the
mentality, "But how will I explain this to bandsmen?  The set of standard
abbreviations does not cover this possibility.  Oh, well, I guess I'll try
something else."

Van mentioned that you're looking for a job at Sun.  Will you have much
time over the summer if you're working fulltime?  Be sure to set doable
goals.  Maybe it would be better to aim for spring show 96.  Gosh, that
sounds like a long time!

Stunt lame?  I don't believe it.  Well, it's the first time I've ever
heard of them being lame, especially about spring show poopsheets.  NOT!
You wouldn't believe how much misery stunt has caused me over the years
with spring show sheets.  The problem is that they are totally
inexperienced and have no idea how much time it actually takes to produce
an error-free show.

Someone needs to teach them how to use the printing program.  Do they know
that it is possible to only print out some sheets?

I viewed and printed the ps files you sent me.  Generally, the Zellerbach
sheets look great!  I assume that you didn't extend the lines past the 40s
with stunt's approval.  The only change I would suggest is to make the
very back line dotted, not solid, like in the old Harmon sheets.  On
stage, that line will not be taped (I think), so it should not be shown on
the stuntsheet as a solid line.

It's too bad I will be missing that flow.  I'd LOVE to see it.  Actually,
it will be even more entertaining in rehearsal.  What's going to happen is
that people are going to try to execute it but will fail miserably on the
first attempt.  Then they are going to give stunt a lot of flack.  But
stunt is inexperienced and they won't know how to deal with the negative
attitudes, so they will bungle the PR aspects of convincing the band that
this flow really is doable.

I wonder whether the flow will really work.  I remember hearing that they
couldn't find basses or percussion to march the show.  Maybe that's why
they decided to try this trick.  They rarely have the opportunity to
march without bulky instruments!

Does the printing program run under X?  If so, can you send me a uuencoded
copy, or put a readable copy in your soda directory so that I can grab it
and ftp?

The "black hole" flow is an important lesson for us calchart designers. 
It is simply impossible to think of everything beforehand.  I guess there
should be an "enlarge" option (and shrink, too!) in the print routine. 
It's never been needed before, and it may never be needed again, but for
the sake of completeness I think it should be included.

I mentioned in the outline that there could be high school football and
professional football printing also.  This would be very easy to implement
since only the hashes would need to be changed.

Well, that's what Spring Show is really all about.  It's a big excuse for
newly elected and selected structure members to show off all of their
supremely wonderful power.  "Stunt can chart any flow we damn well please,
and there's nothing you can do about it!"  Soon enough, their great moral
committments to innovation and experimentation will wear thin, and then
they will go back to simple-minded NSEW NP.  

I think you can tell that I don't have a lot of respect in general for
structure members.  That's because I witnessed so many silly things happen
from the position of an "underling."  I was quite unusual among underlings in
that I actually knew what was going on and was clueful enough to realize
that mistakes were being made.  I generally believe that almost all people
are involved in structure for the wrong reasons.  Even if they don't
realize it or admit it to themselves, they are after power.  Rune and Erin
are certainly that way, but I think that Dick is an exception.

I noticed only 40 bandsmen in the block.  Does this mean that the incredible
lameness of spring show is finally becoming generally realized by the band
at large?

Keep me posted on progress.  I assume you will run into stumbling blocks

In fact, I've never compiled an X program before, so this may be very

I generally think that it is not a good idea to trust someone to
understand a configuration file.  If you do, then those possibilities that
depend on changing the config file will be lost until some other
programmer comes along and studies the code to figure out how things work.
I don't see any reason not to build these ideas as features.  We can hide
them away in submenus if they seem to be getting in the way of normal
everyday use.

I used to have a motto for dealing with power-mad bandsmen: "It's just a
band."  All of these incredibly important band decisions are actually very
minor in the grand scheme of things.  Only band alumni have the knowledge
to distinguish between good decisions and bad decisions; the other
thousands of audience members can't tell the difference.
 
I am very glad to hear that you have enough foresight to see beyond your
few years at Berkeley.  Unless you are planning on being a band director,
you're going to have to find something to do with yourself for the rest of
your life.  I think that Rune is making a terrible mistake with the
complete disregard he is giving for his academics.  He thinks that being
senior manager is going to pad his resume sufficiently.  I guess it would

Wow!  70 is pretty big, even for Harmon.  Can so many marchers fit on the
stage with enough room to move around?  Maybe that's why there's a black
hole in the show.

At first, it seemed like you had done some very illogical things with the
user interface.  But then I realized that this is essentially a very
primitive version of the full Calchart program, so it makes sense.

There is some trouble with the sizing of the popup windows when the main
calchart window is particularly narrow or short.  it seems that the size
of the popup window is determined by ratio to the size of the whole
window.  thus, important text gets cut off when the main window is small
horizontally or vertically, and the popup window is unnecessarily large
when the main window is large horizontally or vertically.

I assume that the + and - icons have no purpose yet.  For what are they
meant to be used?

Obviously, key commands are sorely needed.  Just in the process of
testing, I was already tired of constantly using the pulldown menus.

The Pick Stuntsheets... option in the print popup window just gives an
empty window.  I assume that this means that you haven't yet installed a
way to just print some stuntsheets.  So, I owe stunt an apology for the
comments I made about them not knowing how to print out only some sheets,
since right now that is impossible.

I don't entirely like the way that files are chosen under the Open
command.  It would be nice to doubleclick a file to load it without having
to click on Ok.  Also, I think it would be better to require double
clicking (or click and then Ok) to enter a new directory.

Having to choose the .mas file is rather a pain in the ass.  Will this no
longer be a problem with your new file format.  If it still is a problem,
how about installing a method by which the program can detect that a
subdirectory is dedicated to a single show?  Use a special color to make
them stand out.  When you select that subdirectory, instead of displaying
contents, the show which it contains will be loaded immediately.

I looked at line 22, which contains the reference to strtoul, but it doesn't

I commented the line in bitflip.c with a reference to strtoul, suspecting
that this would cause the routine to behave strangely.  At least the whole
thing finally compiled with this change:

makedepend  -- -I. -Ixlib -Icommon -Iimages  -I/usr/X11R6/include      -DCALCHART_X -DCALCHART_CASESEN -Wall  -- common/main.c common/gui.c common/disk.c  common/config.c xlib/stub.c xlib/images.c  show.c loadshow.c prntshow.c bitflip.c

bitflip.c: In function `main':
bitflip.c:34: warning: implicit declaration of function `puts'
bitflip.c:13: warning: `val' might be used uninitialized in this function
gcc -fpcc-struct-return -o bitflip -O2      -L/usr/X11R6/lib bitflip.o       

The warning about val is not at all surprising.

Anyway, the program started up fine.  I liked very much your help file. 
It is exactly the kind of thing that Martin and I used to do all the time.

So, the change to bitflip.c had an expectedly severe effect on the running
of the program.  Several times in a row, neither big94 nor sprsh95 would
load.  I got a dialog box saying "cannot load big94.mas".  Then,
mysteriously both shows WOULD load, but the result was a very vibrant
chartreuse filling the window without any other indications.  

I thought this was a rather fascinating bug because it didn't crash the
program; just some very intense and interesting side-effects.  Let me know
if you find a way around the strtoul problem in bitflip.c.

I'll save specific comments on the program for a time when I actually get
it running properly.

Hey, that is a good idea.  This seems to be closely linked to the idea of
gridsize, but I'm not sure how zooming and gridsize should interact.

I just tried actually printing, and there was a dialog box saying "0 pages
printed."  so it seems that your analysis is correct: it is loading a show
with 0 stuntsheets.

Don't worry too much about trying to fix things just for my sake.  Of
course, these problems will eventually need to be solved, but all in good
time.

A wise attitude.  I understand that you probably knew everything that I
told you about the program, but I thought that it couldn't hurt to tell
you about the difficulties.

I'm more than happy to test prototypes when you get them working.  Just
put them in your soda account, and notify me.  If nothing else, I will
learn a lot about compiling C programs.

being a smartass is fun.  i always liked giving stunt a hard time.  i
never hassled other TAs really, but stunt was a different matter.  don't
blame yourself for confusing the newmen.  it was stunt's fault for not
specifying the direction.

when i was in high school, my marching band performed one show per season.
i happily marched without getting bored because i didn't know anything else.

after my newman year, i couldn't imagine going back to the
one-show-per-year system.  i could hardly stand a show after three weeks,
let alone three months.

after my first year as a TA, i couldn't imagine having to march every single
run-through.  bad enough having to march on friday and saturday morning. 
Especially pregame.  there's a pattern here.

as i said, don't waste a lot of time trying to get the program to run

Oh, that's a good reason for me not being able to find the file.  :)  I
don't feel quite as lame as a stunt member who prints out the show 5
times before sending it to the printers.

I'm not sure what you are saying, but I will generally discuss zooming and
grid size.

Zooming in and out is pretty obvious, I think.

Grid size should always be a power (positive or negative) of 2.  For example,
2 step, 4 step, 1 step, 1/8 step, or whatever.  There is no need for a minimum
gridsize as long as there is no maximum magnification for zooming.  Just
keep subdividing intervals as magnification increases.

The question I am wondering about is: Does grid size change automatically
when you zoom?  Or does grid size always have to be changed manually? 
Seems like a combination of both ideas would be good. 

Grid size does change when magnification changes, but it can also be set
manually.  Once it is set manually, it will stay fixed at that grid size
regardless of subsequent zooming.  When setting grid size, there is an
option for "auto size."  This would be the way to turn off a manually set
grid size and return to automatic grid sizing.  Does this make sense, or
have I described it poorly again?

No, you've misunderstood me.  When I refer to "grid size," I mean the fact
that the program rounds off locations to the nearest 2-step (or 1-step or
whatever-step) location.  I'm talking about the "G" option in the current
version. 

Grid size should change in powers of two, but zooming can be continuous. 
Divide up all possible magnifications into intervals, and each interval is
assigned a grid size.  For example, 1X to 2X has a 2step grid; 2X to 4X
has a 1step grid; 4X to 8X has a .5step grid; .5X to 1X has a 4step grid;
etc.  The intervals don't have to be exactly these values; I'm just giving
an example of how the grid sizes could be assigned to magnifications.

Viewing stuntsheets side by side would be a huge asset.  I can remember
more than once having to flip back and forth between two stuntsheets
repeatedly.  Eventually, I got frustrated and just printed out a copy of
one of the two sheets.  Obviously, this is not a good way of doing things.

It seems to me that cloning windows would be the best idea.  Same show,
same memory buffer, but you can look at it from two windows at once.  Is
this what cloning means?  Or splitting windows would also work fine, as
long as you can keep the size of each window reasonably large.

It would also be somewhat useful to be able to view two different shows at
once.  My impression is that the easiest way to handle this situation is
to have "load show" and "create window" be distinct processes.  If you
load a show, it goes into the current window; this is how it will be used
most of the time.  Maybe have an option for creating a new window in which
the loaded show will be put.  If you create a window, it will initially
view the same thing that the "current window" is showing.  

Close a window by choosing to close it.  If all the windows of a show are
closed, then it automatically goes out of memory.  Of course, we'll need a
save Y/N prompt before dropping it from memory.

I agree that it is a good idea but not high priority.  Much more important
to get a workable program, then worry about tying up the loose ends and
packaging it nicely.

I had envisioned the type of show (standard, spring show, etc) to be
stored within the data for the show itself.  This data would also be used
to determine what kind of background to put on the stuntsheet editor.

Landscape is an appropriate option for the print popup thing.  Perhaps
overview and turning on and off continuity printing also belongs in the
popup thing, since they don't seem to be of any relevance to the rest of
calchart. 

Also, it is quite reasonable that somebody might want two
versions of a show: one with cont, one without.  Or two versions: one
overview, one normal.  On the other hand, it is quite unlikely for someone
to want two versions: one standard, one spring show format!  Therefore,
the standard/spring show format is really a different kind of question
than overview or continuity/nocontinuity.

It would be more space-efficient to have a small separate window for the
icons, but I think it may get confusing if someone is editing in multiple
windows simultaneously.  I think it will become difficult for the user to
keep track of which window he is working on if he has to constantly refer
to a common icon set.   I would say that if you think the icons will fit
reasonably well in each window, then do it that way.

Editing continuity should bring up a new window.  So should animation.  I
can definitely envision someone checking the stuntsheets while also
viewing the animation, or checking stuntsheets while typing continuity, or
checking continuity while viewing animation, or viewing animation while
editing stuntsheets, or viewing animation while editing continuity, .... 
Anyway, this is a quite useful feature.

Imagine this scenario.  The usual situation involves someone working on a
single show.  The user could probably comfortably set up four windows
semi-permanently: two for viewing stuntsheets, one for continuity, and one
for animation.  These windows could stay open all the time, regardless of
what the user is currently working on.  It's just like when I am writing a
math paper, I have one window with a shell for running lpr or latex or
whatever, two or three windows with text editors, and a ps previewer also.
This seems to be a very comfortable way to work.

I hope it went better than the first.  I'm sure it did; they always get

Come to think of it, I don't remember ever considering changing the amount
of extra space around the grid.  We just copied the precedent from the
earliest version of Calchart.  There were definitely times when I found
this space to be insufficient, particularly for alumni band day with the
snake flow into scriptifornia.  8 steps sounds like a decent default, but
it would be very nice to be able to change it in the config file.

I don't think you should worry too much about standardizing with windows. 
Remember that the program will be able to run on other platforms anyway. 
I think you should tailor things to be useful for this particular purpose.
I really don't see why it is important to have the landscape button in the
same location as in Word.

Seems like a mixture of the two ideas would be best.  Most of the time, I
think the user will want the continuity to appear in the old window, but
sometimes he might want to compare two sets of continuity and will want
another window.  So there should be some way to tell the program which you
want; probably the default should be to use the old window.  Let me think
more about this.

This is a very very big consideration in my opinion because it affects the
convenience of placing points, which is by far the most time-consuming
task.  I think that the auto scrolling in the old version is ideal.  Too
bad that is not reproducible in a windowed environment.  Certainly it is
not possible to eliminate the need for scrolling by placing the entire
field in view because this would make the scale too small to see
conveniently.  Right now, the best thing I can think of is scroll bars, so
I guess that is the working plan.  But I'll give this one some serious
thought tonight.

Nope, nowadays I don't go near anything except the sun sparcstation4's and
sparcstation5's in our computer room.  Occasionally I use a 9600 baud
terminal when the consoles are all occupied.

I'll be reading email continuously through the summer.  Always email me at
math.uchicago.edu.  I telnet from wherever I am to Chicago to read mail.

The math department in Duluth has an older Sun (3/60, maybe?), a newer Sun
sparcstation with color, and a couple of consoles that are SGI (I think
they're SGI, but I can't remember for sure).  The university has a PC lab,
but it is a bit of a hassle to get access there because technically it is
only for students, and I'm not exactly a student at Duluth.  Anyway, I'm
confident that I'll be able to find a machine that can run Calchart.

I have been incredibly busy this quarter.  I'm not going to have a lot of
time to do thorough testing until early June.  But send me stuff anytime,
and I'll be glad to give my opinions.

I guess the solution to this problem is for the program to automatically
adjust the size of the printed image so that all the points fit on the page.
But this adjustment would only occur if the points are already off the
football field (or off the spring show stage).  If all the points are on
the field, then the normal size is used.

I never noticed Rune working particularly hard on any class.  He spent
most of his time on work for the band or work for OCF or work for CCCPB or
whatever, but I never saw him study much of anything.  That may partially
explain his academic troubles.  How's he doing, by the way?  He told me
something about his collapse.

Yes, I know the kind of thing you are talking about with Mac paint
programs.  Most of those ideas are going to be a bit problematic because
it may be necessary to scroll in the middle of a mouse drag.  for example,
you may be dragging out a definition of a geniusmove and need to scroll.
come to think of it, the scroll bars will give the same difficulty here. 
Click, then move, then click will work fine with scroll bars, but not
press-and-hold, then drag, then release.

I understood that the current printing routine doesn't handle automatic
size adjustment, but then again, there's probably many things that it
doesn't yet do....

I don't think it is too important to worry about stuntsheets changing
sizes constantly.  I certainly agree that consistency in size is extremely
useful.  I always flipped back and forth between pages, and it made things
very convenient to be able to look in the same location on both pages. 
However, the idea is to shrink the scale ONLY when placing points off the
field.  This is only going to happen very rarely, and then it will be some
bizarre thing where half the band is off the field.  There's nothing wrong
with printing one stuntsheet per year at a different size.

I thought he had dropped out of school this semester.  Is he still going
to class?  Is he still living in B7?

Actually, I don't think he's going to miss the band terribly much.  He
never liked playing or marching very much.  The only reason he joined was
that his parents insisted.  He's in the band for the administration -
being on adcomm, being senior manager.  Obviously, he can't be the manager
next year, even if he comes back to the band, so I wouldn't expect him to
have much interest in being in the band.  On the other hand, all of his
friends are in the band, so maybe he would want to be with them.  But I'm
quite sure he won't be in the band next fall.

I hadn't thought of the trouble with switching windows.  Yes, this is very
severe.  I wonder why we didn't think of this before?  It goes to show
that you can make all the plans you want, but when you actually get down
to starting the work, there will be difficulties that you didn't expect.

I would prefer having the border be part of the view of the field, rather
than some grey strip at the edge of the window.  This would maximize the
amount of field viewed at any one time.  Also, I think it would have a
more natural feel for the user.  However, this is going to be trouble
because you would have to cross the border to get to the icons and
pulldown menus and so forth.  Maybe there could be a grey strip on top,
but on the sides and bottom the border is part of the view?  I don't
really like the sound of that, either.  This is a tough one.

Here is a variation on your idea of scrolling at different speeds.  The
border is split into two sections.  If you move the mouse into the inside
section, the screen will shift by some discrete amount (8 steps?), but
that's all it will do.  If you move the mouse into the outside section,
the screen will continuously scroll until you pull the mouse back or the
edge of the field is reached.  I like the idea of the discrete amount
because sometimes you want to adjust the view very accurately so that you
can get the whole block on the field, even though it just barely fits. 

If you pass entirely out of the window, you will have caused
some scrolling on the way there.  When you enter a new window, that "exit
scroll" will be undone, so there won't be any annoying scrolling every
time you switch windows.  However, if you reenter the same window, then
the "exit scroll" will not be undone.  This deals with the situation when
you wanted to scroll, but you accidentally put the mouse out of the window.
On your way into a window, the scrolling is disabled.  To change windows
and scroll, you would have to move the mouse into the center and then pull
it back to the scrolling border.

I think the only way to really figure out what to do is to write some code
and give it a try.  I'd be more than happy to give you my opinion.

I was envisioning the shrinking to occur in cases where it is really
necessary.  Conekickers two off the side isn't very important, but a whole

Isn't this method still going to cause trouble in the middle of
individualmove?  Ugh.  The more I think about this, the more I realize
that this is a very significant problem.

Ooh!  This would be neat.  Maybe even a special background showing the
tunnel and so forth.  This could be implemented by making the tunnel part
of the normal football field, but most of the time it never shows up since
it is off the page.  However, if you set points far enough to the north,
it will come into view.  It should be possible to turn off the tunnel
display for use with stadiums other than Memorial.

One general comment about this whole size adjustment thing.  As with most
of our fancy features, it should be possible to disable them.  This lends
great versatility to the program, and might be incredibly useful in some
situation which we fail to envision now.

Oh, I see what you are saying.  Yeah, I guess that would work OK, but it
seems kind of a pain to have to use the keyboard whenever scrolling. 
Well, I guess that's the best suggestion so far.  One problem with this is
that you can only scroll the width of one screen at a time.  I guess there
should be scroll bars for long-distance scrolling.

Is it possible to make scrolling work like the old version when you are in
the middle of an action such as individualmove or inputting data for a
geniusmove?  This might be convenient, rather than having to hold keys and
release them at the right time while holding the mouse button down the
whole time.

I'm glad to hear that it's going to happen.  I was a little worried that
Brad was going to drop the ball on us.  I hope it's being held in room 4? 
That is the traditional Vatican.  Do you know who else was invited?  I
tried to start a policy where all the residents of room 4 were
automatically invited because they were residents of the Vatican, but I
don't think it was received very well by the college.

This customization would only be useful if it was implemented as making a
new data file that stored the shape of the tunnel.  Just like we already
discussed for spring show.  However, I don't think that there's a whole
lot of danger of the shape of the tunnel changing.  On the other hand,
that pesky Hayward Fault could make a big difference....

Oh, I see.  This is getting better.  I think we might want to make it work
like this.  Normally, moving the mouse to the edge of the screen will
cause scrolling as in the old version.  Hold CTRL while moving the mouse
to switch windows.  Alternatively, the user can switch the usage: move the
mouse to switch windows, and use CTRL for scrolling.

Seems like it would be a lot easier to press a key when you want to switch
windows, as opposed to pressing a key every time you want to see what is
on some other yard line.

We still haven't figured out the location of the icons and menu are going
to fit into all of this.

Maybe we should rethink the big picture here.  What if we have only one
full-sized window, instead of many.  This would take away the ability to
view more than one show or stuntsheet.  But we could instead split the
window internally when desired for multiple views.  Use some key to switch
between active windows (like ctrl-O in emacs).  Continuity and animation
come in windows that appear on top of the stuntsheet viewer.  They can be
moved around, off to the side so that you can still see most of the
stuntsheet underneath, etc.

With this setup, scrolling could work just like it always has.  Except
that we STILL have to figure out how to deal with the icons and menu bar.

That's OK.  I don't think that Ian or Rune would make very good cardinals
anyway.  I technically invited Rune last year, but we both knew he
wouldn't want to come anyway.

You'll want to get some trash bags or something before the conclave to

I always had a lot of work to do after performances cleaning up and stuff.
But I really liked wearing my uniform, so I would always finish my work in
uniform, and then change at the very end.  

Once, I don't remember why, but I wore my uniform after a performance until I
went to bed that night.  I recall walking Susan home from TH.  We met Tim
Klohk, an ex-bandsman, on the street.

At HSBD 93, I had to go in the equipment with a chaperone in search of
lunches that had been left on a bus.  It's a long story, but we ended up
walking along lower University Ave.  I was in my full uniform, including
hat.  That was a lot of fun.

I don't think I ever wore my uniform to class, at least not that I can
recall.  I seem to remember bringing my SHB vest and straw hat to class, but I
didn't put them on until afterwards.

None of these sound very good.  I would sacrifice the advantages of
multiple windows for the old scrolling method, but there would still be
the problem with selecting icons.  I think we have no choice but to go
with option 2.

However, there are some little ways to soup it up to make it a bit more
efficient.  For example, if you click on a icon immediately after rapidly
passing through the scroll zone, then the scrolling is undone.  Or maybe
make a small time delay so that if you cross the scroll zone very quickly,
then there will be no scrolling at all.

I don't have a very good sense for how this would be to work with.  I'd
really like to try a prototype.  Is it possible to write a small program,
with no capabilities except for scrolling, so that we could see what it
would be like?

I understand this, but there is a pretty big disadvantage with this
scheme.  Usually, it is best to center the particular location of interest
so that you can see how things relate on all sides.  With the above plan,
the user would have no control over this; location of points on the screen
would be determined by their location on the field.  For example, points
in the southwest will always appear near the top left corner of the window.

Actually, come to think of it, this might not be so bad.  If possible, I'd
like to give it a try before giving a definitive opinion.

Whatever.  I guess you could make templates for the Coliseum and the Rose
Bowl if you were really bored and wanted to pretend that you were doing
something useful for the band.  Every time the band went to a bowl, you
could get plans for the stadium ahead of time and print out new tunnel
sheets.  Not terribly useful, but a nice way to "show off" our really cool
adaptable program.

I don't understand your explanation about why any point on the field can
be centered.  It seems to me that if the pointer is in the exact center of
the screen, then necessarily only the exact center of the football field
will be displayed.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding you; a prototype will cure
that.

I don't really care which you write first, although I suspect that the
first option is most likely to be the one we end up with.

Eagerly awaiting prototypes,

It seems to me that an attainable deadline to set for yourself is to have
a full-fledged program working for next fall.  That gives you about 11
months to get it working, debug, and put in the finishing touches.  You
could also shoot for spring show, but I think that is rushing things a bit.

Don't worry too much about in what order Stunt wants you to do things.  It
is best to do them in the order that proper programming demands. 
Otherwise, you will end up with a patchwork that is not really most
efficient.

After thinking about this issue for a while, here is the conclusion I have
come to.  The program will convert continuity commands into readable
marching instructions in the obvious way.  Of course, this option can be
turned off.  Also, the user can manually edit the marching instructions
after they are generated by the program.  One big problem is what to do
when the user edits the instructions, then changes the continuity
commands?  I'm sure we can figure something out for that problem.

Now for the continuity language.  I think we should expand the language to
include lots of synonyms.  For example, FMHSDM and FMHS/DM mean the same
thing as HSDM.  However, I am definitely opposed to allowing "English" to
enter the language.  For example, "to S.S. 5" should NOT be a synonym for
NP.  The problem with allowing English is that there are just too many
ways to punctuate and rearrange words; the program is just too likely to
get confused.  Then stunt will whine that the program is broken.

[Erin: You probably don't care to read about this issue in such detail,
but Gurk mentioned to me that the automatic marching instructions
generator was something that Stunt had specifically requested.]

[Gurk and Erin: See what happens when I get back to Chicago and don't have
enough non-mathematics to do?  I start over-thinking minor issues and
writing longwinded explanations.]
 
Just for clarity, "marching instructions" refers to the text that appears
on the stuntsheets, and "continuity commands" refers to the internal
program's instructions.

I'm still not confident that this automatic marching instructions is a
good idea.  Here is a very specific example.

Let's say that a stuntsheet has 64 beats.  For the first 32, the solidmen
marktime while the plainmen do one of those argyle step2 drills so that
they end up in the same place where they started.  For the last 32,
everybody does a big push towards the east. 

The continuity commands would look something like this:

	PLAIN:				SOL:
		MT STEP(2 2 R1) E		MT 32 E
		FM 4 E				FM 32 E
		FM 4 W
		MT REM-32 E
		FM 32 E

The automatic marching instructions would look something like this:

	1/1	[PLAIN]: Step 2 drill as per arrows [MTHS E before and
			 after you go]
				FMHS 4 E
				FMHS 4 W
		[SOLID]: MTHS 32 E
			 FMHS 32 E

	9/1	[PLAIN]: FMHS 32 E

But the way that the marching instructions SHOULD appear is this:

	1/1	[PLAIN]: Step 2 drill as per arrows [MTHS E before and
			 after you go]
				FMHS 4 E, FMHS 4 W
		[SOLID]: MTHS 32 E

	9/1	ALL: FMHS 32 E
	
There are lots of subtleties like this that the program is going to miss. 
Unless we make the instructions generator very intelligent so that it
looks for commonalities between the various continuity commands for
different symbols, it is never going to be able to handle the concept of
"ALL".

You may think that the first version of the marching instructions is
really just as good as the second version.  But it's not.  The second
version emphasizes the fact that EVERYONE is doing a push at 9/1.  This is
an important piece of information for marchers; they should be able to get
a sense for what the flow is going to be like, just by scanning the
marching instructions.

Of course, sometimes there are very intricate flows, and no matter how you
try to explain it, people will have no idea what is supposed to happen. 
But as a general rule, marching instructions should convey information
about the whole flow.  Not all unambiguous sets of instructions are equal.

Even if we build the program to deal with "ALL", there are going to be
many other problems as well.  How are we ever going to convince ourselves
that we've thought of everything.  We CANNOT depend on Stunt to manually fix
the things that the computer does poorly, because you and I both know that
they will get lazy and won't bother.  

I guess the only way that I would feel comfortable with the automatic
instructions generator is to test it against the last few years' (say 2 or
3 years) stuntsheets.  

We face a dilemma here.  If our generator is not very effective (say
it does the right thing only 50% of the time), then people will be annoyed
with it and won't use it at all.  If our generator is very effective (say
it does the right thing 95% of the time), then people will learn to depend
on it and won't bother to fix it themselves the other 5% of the time.  

The question we have to answer is: does the 5% really make a difference? 
We have to weigh the added convenience to stunt against slightly less
clear marching instructions.  In my opinion, clearer instructions are more
important than stunt's convenience.

Here are some arguments that you can use to convince Stunt.  Tell them
that their professional expertise is so finely honed that no computer
could ever match them in their ability to write marching instructions. 
Tell them that if their job gets too easy, then bandsmen will notice that
they aren't working very hard and they will lose respect and prestige.

I'm just not comfortable with the idea of a program writing prose.  To me,
marching instructions are essentially that.  They are NOT merely a list of
unambiguous commands.

i can't remember if i answered this already... i am cleaning out my inbox.

anyway, i think this is a perfect idea.  yes dan, i understand your
concerns about the automatic continuity thing, and i do think stunt
will later on get lazy and not bother to check.  the main reason was to
not write stuff down wrong (slash instead of backslash, nsew instead of
ewns, etc.) so some kinda of split screen would seem to fix this problem.

so, i think this is pretty much a perfect solution.  good thinking, gurk.

This sounds pretty neat.  Are people actually watching the animation?  Is
it just a novelty that will wear off?  Is it helping people learn the
show?  I'm guessing that it's not too useful for bandsmen, but it is
useful for charters.

How are things going generally on the project?  I haven't heard any
updates from you in a long time.

Here are some of the observations I've made so far.  By no means am I 
finished testing this version.  If you don't understand what I'm talking

Calchart hasn't (yet) caused the system to crash, so I guess that's a 
good sign.

I couldn't figure out how to move blocks.  I could only move one point at
a time.

How far back can you go with undos?  Up to the most recent save?  There
should be a warning message when you reach the point where there are no
more dos to undo.

There should be a way to undo an undo.

> springshow mode

Zellerbach grid should go out to the 35s, except in the front where they
only go to the 40s.  See spring show stuntsheets for the correct shape.

> changing number of points, labels

Since it is absolutely necessary that the first thing a user does is create
some points with the show info box, perhaps the show info box should
automatically appear when you make a new show.

The points per letter variable does not do the right thing.  Most of the 
time I couldn't get it to do anything besides 10 per letter, even though 
the displayed value was smaller.  Once I managed to get it to do 1 per 
letter, but I couldn't reproduce that.

There should be a block spacing option when creating new points.  Perhaps
there should also be a location option.

> changing symbols, label positions

Slashes should be thicker.  I can hardly see them.

Use something other than A0 for the label icons.  I was thinking you were
talking about rays and lines for a while.  If you use a number that is
not possible to be mistaken for a letter (like 3), that would be better.
Is there anything we could do that is clever or cute here?

Number labels start with 0, not 1.  This is not a big problem, but it
does not conform with stunt's conventions.

My version doesn't even have a backwards play option.

There should be icons to jump to beginning and end and to sheets by name.

Need to be able to hold "next beat" for long-distance scrolling.

There are some funny things going on when you use the points-per-letter and 
zoom slides.  They jump all over the place.  This causes trouble in using 
the slide to set the value.  Grid moves around, too.

When I use the points-per-letter slide, I get funny green dashed lines all
over the place.

What is the text box within the showinfo box for?

Using the slide to set the zoom value does change the magnification, but it
does not cause the displayed number to change.  Also, non-integer values
for zooming do not get corrected.  For example, if I type "5a" for zoom, the
window goes to zoom level 5, but the displayed value is still "5a".

I get confused when using the buttons with the pulldown menus.  Only the
right button gives the pulldown menu.  The left button automatically
selects the first option on the pulldown menu.  This is a pretty big
problem because the first option on the file menu is "new show".  Several
times I accidentally erased stuff because of this.  Is this just an
artifact of the version I am using, or what?

When you set a title, the old title should be displayed for editing.
Add a button to erase the entry.

Sheet titles probably should not be copied when making new stuntsheets.  
A good choice for default name would be the number of the sheet.

At large zoom sizes, I can't view the entire field, even if I scroll.  The
scroll bars need to be recalibrated or something when the zoom size changes.

Need ticks along the sideline.  Maybe the numbers should be further from
the sideline; I'm not sure about that.

Pro field hashes are 18ft6in apart, not 22ft6in apart like you show.  Is 
this a problem?

What should the values for zoom, grid, and so forth be when you 
open a new window?  Default values, or same as what they just are in 
the parent window?  It seems like same as what they are in the parent 
window is a good idea.

Saving an unnamed show (with "Save", not "Save as...") causes the program 
to crash.

Redrawing needs to be limited to the affected regions of the field, not 
the whole screen.  Too much flashing right now.

If you type a new value for grid or zoom but don't hit return, nothing 
changes.  This is different than other things like number of points, 
where you click on an apply button.  We need to unify the conventions 
somehow.

I think a redo item would be a good idea.  Either suggestion for dealing 
with no more dos to undo is fine.

OK, I admit that I'm out of touch with how things are being done.  I 
think it makes a lot of sense to make the grid slightly bigger than 
necessary, as opposed to slightly smaller.  The problem with the bigger 
grid is that it gives stunt an irresistable temptation to design flows 
that pass through walls.

I just realized that "Show Info" means "Information about the current 
show" as opposed to "Display information".  Suddenly, the show info box 
seems a lot less obscure than it used to seem.  I'm starting to think 
that it's OK the way it is (requiring the user to open the show info box 
to create points).

I agree.  The location option isn't very important.

OK, but there should be a backwards play option.

The slider sounds like a good idea.  I think there are times when it would
be easier to figure out where you are if all of the sheets are listed in a
column.  The current sheet could be highlighted, or something.

Well, I guess forwards and backwards play can take the place of scrolling.

This is a very good idea.  The difficulty of archiving is a MAJOR problem
with the old version.

Don't worry about problems that are XView-local.  The important thing is 
that it works well with MS-Windows, since that is going to be the 
platform for the foreseeable future.

Actually, the correct algorithm is a bit more complicated.  I believe we 
talked about this a long time ago.  Adding a sheet to the end of the show 
should cause the new name to be "n+1", where "n" is the name of the old 
last sheet.  Adding a sheet to the beginning makes "n-1", where "n" is 
the name of the old first sheet.  Adding a sheet between "n" and "n+1" 
makes the name "na".  Of course, if the nearby sheet titles are not 
integers, then just put the number of the sheet as the name.  Is this too 
tricky to implement?  It may sound complicated, but I think it would save 
the user a lot of time.

I don't see why they shouldn't be there.  If they are on the field, then 
they should be on the stuntsheet.  I am inclined to print the big yard 
numbers, too.  But that gets difficult with colors and stuff like that.

If that's how it's practiced, then that's how you should print them.

Bugs for the 011896 version.

I got segmentation faults when I tried to load big94.mas, ewf6.mas, or
sprsh95.mas (I downloaded them from your soda directory).  Also, big94.tar
is incomplete or something.  This means that I can't yet test much in the
edit-continuity and animation line.  Until I can load an already-existing
show, I've pretty much tested everything that I can right now. 

Whenever you change the magnification, the view jumps to the southwest
corner.  Probably it should preserve the center, unless the entire field
will now fit into the view.

Reducing the number of points causes an arbitrary set of points to be 
deleted.  The user should be able to select which points get erased.

The points-per-letter variable seems to be working fine now.

The word "Tempo" is placed partially off the edge of the animation window.

The tempo slide in the animation window does not work.  You can type a 
number manually, but you can't adjust it with the slide.  Strange, 
because it was working in the 011596 version.

I like how selecting points shows up on all sheets.  I think this is the 
right way to do it.  I tested things like looking at two different 
stuntsheets of the same show at once, and blockmoving points on one of the 
sheets.  The points on the other sheet did not move, which is what is 
supposed to happen.

I'm getting messages like "Deleting window from list of 3 elements." in 
my shell window whenever I close a window.  These messages should be 
surpressed somehow.

Is it going to be a problem that more than one show info window can be
opened for the same show?  I tried creating some kind of contradiction,
but everything seemed to work.  The only trouble I could find was that the
information in the second box does not get updated when you apply changes
in the first show info box.  This does not cause any disasters, but it 
can get confusing when different boxes are showing different information.

Windows need to be labeled better to keep track of things when more than 
one show is being displayed.  Need to cross-label show-info, animation, 
and edit-continuity windows so that the user knows which window goes with 
which show.

Do the show-info, animation, and continuity windows have to die when the 
main window is closed?  I can foresee a situation where you want to copy 
continuity but don't care about the view of the field.  In order to 
reduce cluttering in the workspace, it might be convenient to get rid of 
the main window.

Fortunately, every (finite) stage is contained in some rectangle.  So 
stunt can just ignore the corners if necessary.

I'd say that "0" comes before "1", and "-1" comes before "0".  If I were 
on stunt and had to add two sheets to the beginning of a show, I would 
call them "-1" and "0".  But maybe not everyone thinks like me.

This confusion is caused by my ignorance; sorry.  I think I understand now.

I like the idea of displaying the large numbers, if you think it is 
possible to create a readable printed sheet.  Presumably it would help 
bandsmen with alignment, too.  Beware that the size and shape of the 
numbers do change on different fields.  Obviously, you should design 
yours to match Memorial.

Why not add endzones to the on-screen display?  You could have some fun 
with it by writing "GOLDEN BEARS" in it.  Or maybe make it optional.

Presumably you mean fixed sliders?  Because the scrolling still isn't
working.  This is probably a silly question, but what do you mean by "list
boxes"?

All of the other sliders work fine.  If I type in a tempo and press 
ENTER, the position of the slider changes to match the new tempo and the 
speed of animation does in fact change.  However, if I try to drag the 
slider around, nothing happens.  Actually, sometimes it changes the tempo 
by one or two, but I can't get it to do that consistently.

I was fooling around with this again, and I noticed one other thing about 
animation.  If you change the tempo while the animation is playing, the 
speed is not affected.  You have to press stop, and then start playing 
again to get the animation to run at the new speed.  [This is the kind of 
bug where I feel like I am useful; it's not such an obvious thing, but it 
ought to be done right.]

Now that I think about it, I see the problem with having a continuity 
window open without the field window also.  The big issue are the menus on 
the field window.

It seems to me that the parent/child relationship is working as it 
should.  I like the fact that when you create a new field window, it does 
not really behave like a child of the original field window.  That is, 
when you close the first field window, the new one stays open. 

With better labels for the various windows, it will be clear which child
windows go with which parents windows.

Did I ever tell you what we did the first year for Zellerbach.  We 
printed the show on the old Harmon sheets.  We took a piece of paper with 
the outline of the Zellerbach stage on it (ie., the walls, edge of stage, 
and so forth) and cut a hole in it to match the shape of the grid that we 
wanted.  Then we put this template over the Harmon-style sheets and 
photocopied one at a time.  It was a bit of a hassle, but it actually 
worked very well.

I didn't mean to be nitpicky with the terminology.  Of course, I don't 
actually know what I'm talking about.  I just got lucky with the fact 
that I happenned to be using standard wxwindows terminology.  If I don't

Whatever.  This is one of those problems for which my opinion is 
valueless.  I am unable to weigh programming difficulty against user 
benefit, because I have no conception of programming difficulty.

I downloaded the debug version again (which happenned to have the same 
name as the previous one; did I get the correct new version?), and the 
exact same thing happenned when I tried to load a show.  By the way, just 
to make sure, I'll tell you more specfically what I do to make the

click on ewf6.mas to make it appear in the box at top, then click OK.

I'm glad to hear that you are seriously thinking already about the 
manual.  I am more than willing to help on this part of the project (or 
even write it if you don't want to).

Ideally, there ought to be two parts to the manual, one part a tutorial 
on how to use Calchart so that Stunt can chart their spring show flows, 
and the other part a technical reference manual for the experts to figure 
out how to do 6-step diagonal military countermarches.

Each spring, there is a new batch of stunt members who are totally 
clueless about a lot of things, including calchart.  However, they need 
to learn how to use calchart quickly because they have to chart spring 
show.  So, there ought to be something for them to read so that they can 
learn the basics quickly and get started.  The tutorial part should be 
written with a rookie stunt member in mind.

The technical part should be written for users like you and me.

The orientation of the spring show sheets has always been a problem.  I 
don't know why the sheets weren't turned around sooner.  It makes a lot 
of sense to always always have north to the right.

However, a bit of confusion is unavoidable since the Zellerbach stage is 
turned the other way around.

The situation you describe is exactly the one case where the orientations 
get confusing.  It happens when you want to do a show twice, when the 
second time the orientation of halftime switches relative to the orientation
of pregame.

Does this discussion have any relevance to Calchart design?  Maybe there 
ought to be a "reverse orientation" feature that turns the whole show 
upside-down and also adjusts the continuity.  Actually, there should be 
two routines, one for flipping about the north-south center line and one 
for rotating 180 degrees about the midpoint of the 50yard line.

I also had to flip a show once or twice during my tenure.

What do you mean by "special code"?  I think you mean that the user types 
something like "\E" as a shorthand notation for "east".  Then the 
flipping routine would not actually change any data; it would just 
reinterpret "\E" to mean "west".
This is not a bad idea, but there are other things, such as NSEW, that 
will also have to be marked with special codes.

Are there any other uses for the special codes?  Flipping is not such a
common thing; it doesn't seem worthwhile to type all those special codes
all the time just in case you later decide to flip the show. 

Maybe we should use a special code to mark the fact that what follows is
"normal text". 

Here are two examples of what I mean.  The first has directions and 
commands as special codes, and the second has "normal text" marked specially.

Example 1:
	FMHS \NSEW \NP [\MTHS \E]

	Step 2 drill as per arrows [MTHS E before and after you go]
		FMHS \4 \N, FMHS \4 \S

Example 2:
	NSEW NP [MTHS E]

	{Step 2 drill as per arrows [MTHS E before and after you go]}
		FMHS 4 N {,} FMHS 4 S

Hi Gurk-

I would say that if it is easy to transfer the Mac version over to the 
Cal Band computer to do the final printout, then yes, i think this would 
be very beneficial.  but it would have to be able to transfer over.

i know i had to do some charting at home on Mark's computer because I 
only have a mac.

One questions though, how would the mouse work?  Most Mac's have a mouse 
(at least mine does) with only one button.  would it only be able to go 
forward?

another thing, how much would it cost?  if it isn't TOO much, the band 
just might pay for it... maybe.  i would hate for you to spend your own 
money on it.

about adm-poop stuff, i think the best time to go through everything will 
be after spring show, so we'll try to do something then.

love, erin

I have a Mac C++ compiler.  So if you want to work something out.  Also, 
how are you doing the graphics cross-platform? (What's your toolkit?)

I think it would be a great idea to have Cal Chart for Macintosh.  I think
having it on various platforms it will make it easier for charters and TAs.
I know for me, if I become a TA, I woudl feel a lot more comfortable using
a Macintosh to work with Cal Chart.  Hope everthing goes well.

I finally got around to checking this out.  I skimmed through the section 
that you suggested, and I don't think that there will be any problems.  
The only moderately complicated things that we will be doing are 
inserting some figures and making an index.  I didn't see any references 
to making an index, so I'm not sure if Tex2RTF will support that.  There 
is a fairly nice way of doing indices with Latex.

I have looked at both versions a bit, and I have already noticed a few 
bugs that occur with one version but not the other.  Most of the bugs 
that I have already found occur in both versions.  So if you want to 
claim to be supporting both versions, then you had best continue to make 
both versions available so that I can find bugs.

I don't have an opinion about the importance of supporting both Motif and 
XView because I don't know the technical differences.  So, you should 
decide whether you want to continue to support both or not.  Maybe you 
could make only one available most of the time, but once in a while you 
should make both available.

I will send you a bug report by the end of the week.

Dan

Here is a preliminary list of bugs that I have found.  It is far from 
complete; there are many features that I haven't played with thoroughly yet.

All the bugs listed apply to the Motif version.  Probably they also apply 
to the XView version, but I haven't explicitly tested them.  However, the 
ones marked XV have been reproduced on the XView version.

I am particularly proud of my work on number 18 (see below).

1(XV). When I select "help", I get a message in my shell window saying that 
the program cannot find "wxhelp"; this is the problem that you told me 
would occur.  However, the program freezes; then a dialog box appears 
with a warning about "timing out after 15 seconds".  After I close the 
dialog box, the whole process starts all over again.  The only recourse 
is to kill the process externally.

2(XV). Loading a show still results in a seg fault.

3(XV). Extraneous "Deleting show...." messages in my shell window.  Are 
these useful for debugging?  Just don't forget to get rid of them eventually.

4. Extraneous "Deleting window from list of n elements." messages in my 
shell window.  

5.  In the show info box, click on a letter, then scroll.  Funny things 
happen to the dotted lines.

6.  Text editing is fucked up.  Control characters create nonstandard 
symbols, backspace doesn't work, etc.  This applies in such places as: 
setting the number of points in the show info box; the text box at the 
bottom of the show info box; typing how many rows you want in your 
initial formation; etc.

7.  (XV) Having to press ENTER to change the number of points is
illogical.  I believe we discussed this a while ago.  When I started
testing again recently, I couldn't figure out how to add points for quite
a while.  Eventually, I stumbled across the answer.  Anyway, the current
system is too confusing; if I can't figure it out, can you imagine how
confused Stunt will be? 

8.  If you type text in the box at the bottom of the show info box, it 
doesn't reappear when you open the show info box again.

9.  (XV) There is an ambiguity in the name "Show info".  Do you mean it 
as an adjective and noun (ie, "information pertaining to this show")
or do you mean it as a verb and noun (ie, "put the information on the 
screen")?  Can we think of a non-ambiguous synonym?

10.  If two points get put on top of each other, they can later be 
separated by using individual move.  In version 2, the program made an
arbitrary choice as to which point you would be picking up.  It told you 
which one it had selected for you at the bottom of the screen.  Something 
analogous should happen in version 3.  Maybe the program should ask you 
which one you want; at the very least it should tell you which one you've 
got.

11.  Auto relabeling is of course very useful.  But there is potentially 
a time for manual relabeling.  What if I am experimenting, and the points 
get all jumbled up so that there is no nice consecutive pattern to the 
labeling?  Even if I relabel, the labels will still be in the same 
illogical order.  It should be possible to straighten out the pattern, 
even if it requires a lot of manual work.

What I am talking about is the fact that the labels in the pregame wedge 
are in a nice pattern; usually the first page of a halftime show is the 
same way.

12.  You can't undo immediately after an undo.  Why not be able to undo 
an undo operation?  Or do something like emacs and be able to undo the 
last n operations.

13.  When moving individual points, I am slightly bothered by the fact 
that the drawn line moves continuously rather than snapping to the grid.  
It really ought to snap to the grid, since that better reflects what the 
move is actually going to be.  Unless of course you have selected no 
grid, in which case it is fine to move continuously.

14.  Saving seems to work, in the sense that a file is created.  However, 
loading it results in a seg fault (see 2).

15.  The points-per-letter slide in the show info box is too short.  Tiny 
movements of one pixel can cause the number to change by more than one.

16.  Lots and lots of warnings in my shell window.  We already talked 
about these.

17.  There are problems with refreshing the screen far away from the 
field proper.  This only occurs when your window is much bigger than the 
entire field (for example, at very low zoom sizes).

When you switch to spring show mode, the screen is not refreshed 
properly.  Changing the zoom size was the only way I could find to force 
it to refresh.

If you put points far far away from the football field then remove them 
by reducing the number of points on the show info grid, they don't get 
erased.  Of course they don't exist anymore, but they still appear on screen.

I suspect that both of these problems are symptoms of the same bug.

18.  Although the set of possible locations for points is theoretically
infinite, the region that you are capable of seeing is bounded by the size
of your monitor.  If a point lies over your "horizon", you can never get
it back.  Of course, there's no way to get the points over your "horizon"
in the first place.  Or is there?  I have found two ways.

Let's say you add 1000 points and choose to have only one point per 
row.  This will create a really long line along the south endzone.  It 
will spill far off the field, and probably off the screen unless you have 
a very big window. 

The other way is to use block move.  Blockmove a line of points by 
indicating where one end will go.  It is possible to manuever the other 
end over the horizon.

If you use the second trick on the top edge of the window, the points 
will be displayed as piled up along the edge of the window.  Although 
they are displayed there, they aren't actually there.  Their actual 
location is exactly where they ought to have been translated into the 
"negative" region of the plane.

You may wonder how I know what their actual location is when they are off 
in unviewable "negative land".  If you block select points and your 
rectangle spills out of your window, it affects the selected region even 
if it isn't displayed.  I used this fact to gain information about the 
locations of the undisplayed points.  Pretty clever, huh?

I think the ideal solution to this problem is this.  When points are very
far away from the football field, the scrolling routines should recognize
this and allow you to scroll that far.  This solution still provides for
the theoretically infinite plane, which is a nice thing.  And it avoids
the obstruction of the "horizon" that I talked about. 

One problem with this suggestion is that it still is not easy to put a 
point very far away.  (Don't ask why you would ever want to set a point 
out in the parking lot outside the stadium :) )  There should be a way to 
tell the scrolling routines to let me go a certain prescribed distance, 
even though there aren't points out there yet.

19.  It's impossible to use letter labels with more than 260 points.  Is 
it worthwhile inventing a scheme with double letters (AA, BB, etc.)?  Or 
should we just forget about it and expect that the band will never get 
that big?  Certainly there do exist bands that are that big.

Loading shows works now.

Am I supposed to do something to the wxhelp file before using it?  When I
click on the help menu item, I get the following messages in my shell
window: 

	./wxhelp: syntax error at line 1: `(' unexpected
	select in wxSleep: Interrupted system call

After playing around with both versions, I have decided that I prefer the
motif version to the xview version.  I don't know why exactly; it just has
a more comfortable feel to me.  However, I will continue to test whatever 
you want me to.

I forgot to get XKeysymDB before, but now I have done it.  Things work 
much better.  Both backspace and delete work fine.  Also, all the warning

I don't see how the animation is much of a problem.  You could add 
scrolling to the animation when necessary so that all the points can be 
seen, even though perhaps not all at once.

Here is my suggestion for interface design to deal with this problem.  
There will be variables defining the north, south, east, and west 
boundaries of the viewable region.  In the current version, these 
variables are fixed at 10N, 10S, 10W, and 10E respectively.  My 
notation "nX" means "n yards beyond the X side of the field".

If you move a point off the field, then the variables get changed
automatically so that there is always a 10yard zone around the outside of
the viewable region without any points in it.  The viewable region can
expand AND contract automatically in this way, but it never gets smaller
than the full field plus 10 yards on all sides. 

The user can manually set these variables if he so desires.  The values 
can be typed in directly.  Is there a good way to allow for graphical 
definition of these values?  Selecting a region, or something?  I can't 
think of anything satisfying.  There should also be an easy way to return 
to the "normal" situation.

Once the user manually sets values, the automatic method will never 
contract the region beyond those values.  However, it will expand as 
necessary (and contract after expansion, as long as it doesn't drop below 
the manually set values).

Negative values for the variables are allowed.  This would have the 
effect of preventing you from scrolling to all parts of the field.  I'm 
not sure why you would want to do this, but it should be possible.  In 
this case, the automatic method neither expands nor contracts.

There are two constraints: [north] + [south] > -100 and [east] + [west] >
53 1/3.  The program will not accept data violating these values.

Strictly speaking, it could be possible to allow for data violating these 
constraints.  This would have the effect of reversing the orientation of 
the display so that north is to the left, or whatever.  But I don't see 
any reason to allow for this.

So, adding CalChart to the standard Band program manager and trying to
figure out how to best configure it I have these suggestions/questions:

Is there a way to specify the default data directory?  In order to 
get it to read the configuration file I had to make the default 
directory S:\CALCHART, which then means that they get dropped into
S:\CALCHART when they want to open a file or save a file or whatever,
which is a lot more confusing then getting dropped into some standard
place where they actually have write permissions  :-)  Is there a 
way currently to do this?  Make the program and config file be in
the S:\CALCHART, and then have the default data directory someplace
like G:\ or U:\ or R:\?  How about even a little more complicated--
Program is in S:\CALCHART, config file is in U:\, standard data
directory is G:\CALCHART.  Is this possible?  How about with a
command line option giving the config file location (this is how
a lot of other Windoze programs do it).

Anyway, that's my question.

Talk to you soon.

After grabbing XKeysymDB, everything seems to work perfectly.

Here is an initial list of comments.  Many more to come over the next few 
days.  Except for the first three, they all pertain to the show info window.

1)  I had trouble unzipping the archived shows.  unzip responds with 
"Unknown compression method".

2)  When I try to use help, I get error messages because wxhelp is not 
available.  After two 15-second attempts, it gives up.  This is basically 
fine, but I was wondering if there is a way to abort the process so that 
you don't have to wait for 30 seconds before you regain control.

3)  Changing the zoom size causes the screen to be refreshed twice.  I 
think that this is a result of the way that you fixed a previous bug that 
I mentioned.  Anyway, this is generally inefficient and annoying.  Also, 
sometimes there is a significant delay of several seconds between the 
first and second refresh.

4)  I am much less confused by the "set labels" and "set num points" 
buttons.  Did you change something?  I don't remember how it was.

5)  Why is there a scroll bar underneath the letters?

6)  Same thing about "not enough labels defined".  I know it's not that 
important, but still worth mentioning.

7)  When you open the window, the cursor in the comments window appears 
at the end of the text.  Should the cursor appear at the beginning of the 
text?  I'm not sure what is the convention.

8)  Funny things still happen to the dotted line when you scroll through 
the letters.  We already discussed this and you blamed it on a bug in 
some standard library, but I don't accept excuses! 

9)  Is there a way to (de)select blocks of letters?  Or all letters?  If 
not, there should be.

10)  We had discussed the ambiguity in the name "Show info...."  I 
propose "Information" as the name of the window.

11) I see that you have made great progress in dealing with more than one 
"Information" window open at once.  The number of points and the 
points-per-letter are transferred correctly; that is, when you implement 
the change, the other windows change accordingly.

However, the comments do not get updated.  I see two ways around this, 
but I'm not sure if either is doable.  First, you could have the comments 
appear only in the first "Information" window; all the rest wouldn't even 
have a field for comments.  Second, you could transfer changes from the 
first window to the second when you select the comments field of the 
second. 

Which version of the comments gets stored as the official version when 
you close all the windows?  It seems arbitrary to me.

There are some very strange things going on with the selected letters for 
labels.  When you set labels in one window, the other window gets updated 
in a completely bizarre manner.  I can't even figure out what is 
happenning, let alone why.

12) (De)selecting letters does not get "remembered" after closing and 
reopening unless you clicked on "set labels".  Is this the way it should 
be?  I guess so.

I am limited by the fact that I can't get any of the archived shows to

of restricting destinations of individualmoves to a certain set of points.
There could be an option to restrict destinations to the points on a circle
with a given center and a given radius.  There could even be a suboption to
restrict further to N evenly spaced points around the circle.  I imagine
this being implemented as a "Circle..." option on the grid menu.  I believe
that this will be a significant aid to users.

Come to think of it, this might be generalizable to other kinds of curves,
but I think that could wait for Version 3.1.


Here are a whole bunch of comments.  More will come tomorrow or on Thursday.

1)  In general, there is too much screen refreshing.  It is both slow and
annoying.  Martin dealt with this problem effectively by refreshing locally.
Is this possible?

2)  The *.shw and *.mas inconsistency for default names is still present.

3)  Moving the zoom slide and returning it to its original position causes an
unnecessary refresh.

4)  The label font seems a little bit too big.  Three-digit labels should be
easily readable at two-step spacing.  Right now, it looks like 141, 151, 161,
..., instead of 114, 115, 116, etc.

5)  I am very pleased with the snap-to-grid for moving.  It makes 1step
locating much easier because you can count the jumps from a corner.  It also
makes low zooms actually useful for more than just overviewing.

6)  A zoom change always returns the view to the SW corner of the field.
I think the center point of the view should be preserved under change of zoom,
unless the entire field will fit into the view in which case the field should
be located in the upper left corner of the view.

7)  Label flips works perfectly.

8)  Lassoing should NOT snap to grid, no matter what the grid setting.

9)  Aren't "plain slash men" usually called just "slashmen"?  Regardless, the
band's convention should be what you use.  This is important for the help bar
at the bottom of the window.

10) When you make a new sheet, the name of a sheet gets copied from the
previous one.
I remember we had a very long discussion about an auto-naming scheme.  What
happenned to that idea?

11) Probably a good idea to ask for verification before deleting a sheet.

12) I think that "Copy sheet before (resp. after)" should be called "Insert
sheet before (resp. after)".

13) Long long names push the sheet number and the "*" offscreen.  How about
a maximum of 32 characters or so?

14) "1 beats".  Is there a way to improve the grammar?
but you and I think like computer scientists.  I'm not sure if itbut you and I think like computer scientists.  I'm not sure if it
15) Blockmoves should not snap all the men to grid, just the "leading" man.

16) In animation window, the sheet number (i.e., "1 of 20") should be
displayed as well as the beat number and the sheet name.

17) Your convention is to show the zeroth beat of a sheet as opposed to
showing the 16th (or whateverth) beat of a sheet.  I think this makes sense
because it agrees with the way that musicians talk about beats.  However,
it is a change from the conventions of version 2.  I'm just pointing out
the difference and that your convention really is an arbitrary decision.

18) In most applications, the last sheet has 0 beats.  However, sometimes
it has beats.  If the last sheet has 16 beats, then the animator will only
go up to 15; you need to add an extra click of animation for the "close".

19) The animation window should have a reverse play button, a jump-to-sheet
option, a jump-to-end, and a jump-to-beginning.  Come to think of it, the
latter three ought to be available in the main window, too.

20) In the animation window, previous-stuntsheet should take you to the
beginning of the current sheet if you are not at the zeroth beat.  Think
about how a CD player works.

I got around the problem by unzipping them with my Chicago account and 
then ftping them to Duluth.  However, it still didn't work.  I got a 
dialog box saying "Error reading points file".  This happenned with two 
shows from 1990; I will try something more recent.

Sorry for the confusion.  We have already had a discussion on this issue 
before.  You pointed out that it was a rather minor question.

I think beginning is good.  We are not envisioning long comments, are we?

No, it definitely wasn't working.

Huh?  Are you sure that we are talking about the same thing?

When you select the Open... option, the filter default is set to 
blahblah/*.mas.  But when you select the Save As... option, the filter 
default is set to blahblah/*.shw.  I know I don't know what I'm talking 
about, but I'm pretty sure that it is possible to deal with this.

Martin designed his own font for versions 1 and 2.  He bitmapped an 
entire alphabet and set of numerals.

I guess I'm just old-fashioned.  I think of it as "inserting" a sheet 
because that's what we used to call it, but others might of it as 
"copying" a sheet.  Here's another possibility: "New sheet before" and 
"New sheet after".

This is one of the most significant mistakes in version 2.  By mistake, I 
mean something that works wrong as opposed to something that just wasn't 
implemented at all.

I agree; your way is correct.

I haven't gotten to testing this yet.  Expect more comments in the 
next few days.

I think that the general solution to the problem is to have the following 
"attitude" about continuity list management.  The technical details will 
become obvious once we think about things the right way.

A continuity should be deleted if and only if it has no men assigned to 
it AND it has no text (excluding whitespace).  I think that this answers 
all of your questions and scenarios.

A continuity should be created whenever men are changed to a symbol whose
contniuity group does not exist AND there are not already men with that
symbol.  What I'm saying is this.  If all the men are plain, all the men
are assigned to PLAIN continuity, and no other continuities exist; then
when you change some men to solid, the SOLID continuity is created.  If
the SOLID continuity already exists, then changing men to solid obviously
does not cause the SOLID continuity to be created.  If some men are plain
and some men are solid, and all the men are assigned to PLAIN continuity; 
then changing more men to solid does NOT create the SOLID continuity. 

I'm not entirely clear yet on the proper way to implement this strategy.  
You seem to be asking the following question: when should the program do 
a check to see if any continuities should be deleted or created?  The 
answer (I think) is: when the number of points is changed; when a symbol 
is changed; when a continuity assignment is changed; when a continuity is 
selected for editing in the continuity editor.  This covers all instances 
of actions that might affect the existence of a continuity group.

The symbol continuities should definitely appear at the top of the list 
in the "standard" order: PLAIN, SOLID, SLASH, etc.  Funny how I think 
about continuity group names in caps.  The other continuities should 
appear at the end of the list.

Undo sounds trickier to work with.  But this seems like it is really part 
of a broader question concerning undoing changes to text.  I suppose the 
thing to do is to consider all of the editing since you selected the text 
window as a single action - an undo will restore the text to its form 
before you started editing it.

I feel that an undo operation should return the program to its status 
before the action had been taken (or as close to the original status as 
possible).  So undoing an automatic continuity group deletion should also 
undo the action that caused the deletion, since these two occurrences are 
really a single action.
