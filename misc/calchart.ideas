   I just thought you might be interested to know that during break I'm 
going to begin the task of rewriting CalChart.  While it will be a while 
before I get past the lowlevel parts of interfacing the hardware and 
reading the files, I'm curious if there are any suggestions you have.  
Here are a few of the changes I'm planning on:
   * Network compatibility (using C will take care of this)
   * Direct printing (including finishing the printing program I wrote)
   * Shows saved in a single file, and using much less disk space
   * Easy portability to other platforms (although this isn't a huge
       concern, a good design will make even the DOS version easier)
   * Elimination of animation files
   * View a show from different sides (probably just east or west, maybe 
       perspective, but I'm not sure if that will be worth the trouble-
       I may have it write a file to load the show into a 3D animation
       program and render it- this will be easier and look better, but 
       will probably take a day or so to render)
   * Allow copying stuntsheets to a different place in the show
   * Allow renumbering a show without splitting it and using hook
   * Use VGA for better resolution
   * Changes in the user interface? (I think it would be more intuitive
       to select points, then change their symbol, move them, do a genius 
       move, etc.)
   * Add more commands, like GV, SHNSEW (FMSH NS/EW)
   * Maybe add drawing tools for the printed copy? (arrows and the like)
   * Plus, a nice GUI interface

  Okay, this may be a little ambitious, but the hardest part of the program 
is the interface.  Once that's written, the rest should be easy.  Of 
course, it'd be nice to just write it for X instead of DOS, but I do want 
this to be used.
  So let me know if you have any suggestions.  Also, if you would like, I 
can mail you the copies of the program when I get anything usable done.
