The usage for calrender is:
calrender nummen numsheets inbase outbase [e]
where nummen is the blocksize, numsheets is the number of stunt sheets,
inbase is the name of the animation files without the .a## extension,
outbase is the base of the output pov files, and 'e' denotes a show charted
to the east.

The render scripts will render each pov file passed as an argument.  To
render a still frame, use renderstill or renderstille (for shows to the
east).  This will produce Targa files which can be viewed with xv.  To
render the frames for an animation:

render.csh *.pov
or
rendere.csh *.pov

This is the most time consuming step.  It will produce gzip'd QRT files
and remove the pov files.

To generate the FLI animation, use the makeanim script:

makeanim.csh *.qrt.gz

This will remove all the QRT files and produce a file called test.fli, which
is a 320x200 FLI animation.

The scripts render2.csh and makeanim2.csh are for higher resolution (640x400)
animations.  These haven't been used.
