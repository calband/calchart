## The Three-Phase Approach (Summary)

Phase 1: MEASURE (1-2 hours)
├─ Add timing instrumentation to resources/tests/sanity_tester.py
├─ Track: command execution, file comparison, Python overhead
└─ Output: Metrics report with exact time breakdown

Phase 2: ANALYZE (30 minutes)
├─ Run instrumented tests
├─ Identify bottleneck:
│  └─ If exec > 80% → Phase 3A
│  └─ If comp > 20% → Phase 3B
│  └─ If overhead > 15% → Phase 3C
└─ Choose implementation path

Phase 3: OPTIMIZE (30 min - 4 hours)
├─ Phase 3A: Multi-thread calchart_cmd (if execution dominates)
├─ Phase 3B: Optimize regex matching (if comparison dominates)
└─ Phase 3C: Optimize test harness (if overhead dominates)

## How to Use These Documents

### Quick Start (5 minutes):
1. Read: 00_START_HERE.md
2. Read: QUICK_REFERENCE.md

### Guided Implementation (2-7 hours):
1. Read: PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md
2. Implement Phase 1 in sanity_tester.py
3. Run tests and analyze metrics
4. Read relevant Phase 3X section
5. Implement Phase 3X

### For Planning/Discussion:
1. Read: PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
2. Use: OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE_INDEX.md checklist
3. Review: VISUAL_WORKFLOW.md diagrams

### For Technical Deep-Dive:
1. Read: PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
2. Read: PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md
3. Review: VISUAL_WORKFLOW.md technical diagrams

## Expected Outcomes

Target Performance Improvement:
- Debug mode: 2-3x faster (example: 60s → 20-30s)
- Release mode: 1.5-2x faster
- Test accuracy: Unchanged (same validation)

How to measure:
- Phase 1 instrumentation generates metrics report
- Before/after comparison shows speedup percentage
- All tests pass with same accuracy

---

## Files to Be Modified During Implementation

Based on findings:
- resources/tests/sanity_tester.py (Phase 1, always required)
- tools/calchart_cmd/main.cpp (Phase 3A, if needed)
- tools/calchart_cmd/calchart_cmd_parse.hpp (Phase 3A, if needed)
- src/core/* (Phase 3A, potentially for parallelization)

## Next Action

→ Start with: 00_START_HERE.md

It's a 5-minute read that will orient you to the entire plan.

Then follow the guided path based on your role:
- Developers: 00_START_HERE.md → QUICK_REFERENCE.md → PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Leads: 00_START_HERE.md → PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
- Visual learners: 00_START_HERE.md → VISUAL_WORKFLOW.md
