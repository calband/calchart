How to release calchart:

The current calchart version is 3.2.2.  In all commands below, substitute that number for $CCVER (meaning when you read $CCVER, type 3.2.2)

0. Increment the version in ccvers.h to CCVER

1. copy trunk to a tag:
$ svn copy -m "copying trunk to tag for version $CCVER" https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/trunk https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/tags/calchart-$CCVER

2. get that tag on your computer
$ svn co https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/tags/calchart-3.2.1 calchart-$CCVER

3. Build the product:
---
For windows:

w1. Follow the instructions in README-win.txt

w2. Install InnoSetup
I use InnoSetup for creating the installer.  Get it from:
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

w3. Build the setup.exe installer:
Open the file CalChartInstallScript.iss with InnoSetup Compiler.  Compile via Build->Compile.

w4. The installer is called setup.exe.  Rename to:
$ cd build-win/InstallerFiles
$ mv setup.exe Install-CalChart-$CCVER.exe

The final product is Install-CalChart-$CCVER.exe
