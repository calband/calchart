How to release calchart:

0. Increment the version in ccvers.h

1. copy trunk to a tag:
$ svn copy -m "copying trunk to tag for version 3.2.0" https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/trunk https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/tags/calchart-3.2.0

2. get that tag on your computer
$ svn co https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/tags/calchart-3.2.0 calchart-3.2.0

3. Build the product:
---
For windows:

w1. make calchart
$ make

w2. Put the project in a directory
$ mkdir CalChart-3.2.0
$ cp -r calchart runtime docs CalChart-3.2.0

w3. Compress the folder (I use compress, but make sure to fix up the extension).
$ mv CalChart-3.1.zip CalChart.3.2.0.zip

The final product is CalChart-3.2.0.zip

---
For Mac:
m1. pre-build so we have all the files we need:
$ export CXXFLAGS="-arch i386"
$ make
$ make html


m2. build the project with xcode
$ cd build-macos
$ xcodebuild -configuration Debug

m3. Edit the dmg_maker.sh to have the right version

m4. Run dmg_maker.sh
$ bash -f dmg_maker.sh

The final product is CalChart-3.2.0.dmg

---
4. Go to the sourceforge page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/calchart
You'll need to be logged in to modify the files.

5. Go to Project Admin -> File Manager

6. Make a new directory for this version (click on the * next to root)

7. Upload the RELEASE_NOTES.txt to the new folder.  Click on RELEASE_NOTES.txt and edit the file details to signify it's a release notes.

8. Upload the CalChart-3.2.0.dmg to the folder.  Click on dmg and edit the file details to signify it's platform is Mac (OS X) and set the release_notes for the file.

9. Repeat for CalChart-3.2.0.zip.  Click on zip and edit the file details to signify it's platform is Windows and set the release_notes for the file.
