How to release calchart:

The current calchart version is 3.5.4.  In all commands below, substitute that number for $CCVER (meaning when you read $CCVER, type 3.5.4)

0.1 Increment the CalChart_VERSION in CMakeLists.txt to CCVER

0.2 Edit README.md and update what bugs have been fixed.

Because you sometimes run into build issues on one platform instead of another, do a build before you do a tag:
1. Prebuild the project to make sure its working
1.0.1: Make sure you note the git HASH you are dealing with.  Make sure both Windows and Mac are on the same hash.

---
For windows:

w1.1 Follow the instructions in README-win.txt

w1.1.1 Copy readme to build-win:
awk 'sub("$", "\r")' README.md > build-win/README.txt

w1.2 Install Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
We've configured CMake to use NSIS to do installations.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/

w1.3 Build the setup.exe installer:
  Compile the ALL_BUILD target for Release by selecting the ALL_BUILD in the CMakePredefinedTargets and Build->Build ALL_BUILD.
  Compile the INSTALL target for Release by selecting the INSTALL in the CMakePredefinedTargets and Build->Build INSTALL.

The final product is CalChart-$CCVER.exe

For Mac:
m1.1 Follow the instructions in README-macos.txt

m1.2 Run the cmake build command to build for release (you may have to run several times)

	$ cd build
	$ xcodebuild -configuration Release

m1.3 Run the cmake package command to build

	$ cpack -G DragNDrop

The final product is build/CalChart-$CCVER.dmg

2. Tag the depot
$ git tag -a v3.5.4 -m "calchart-3.5.4"
$ git push origin v3.5.4

3. Go to a temporary directory on your system to recheck at the tag.  This is to avoid having any unwanted files
$ cd /tmp
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/calband/calchart.git calchart
$ cd calchart
$ git checkout v3.5.4

4. Rebuild the release now that you have the tag (repeat instructions for step 1)

5. Go to the sourceforge page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/calchart
You'll need to be logged in as Administrator to modify the files.

6. Go to Project Admin -> File Manager

7. Make a new directory for this version (click on the * next to root)

8. Upload the README.txt to the new folder.  Click on README.txt and edit the file details to signify it's a release notes.

9. Upload the CalChart-$CCVER.dmg to the folder.  Click on dmg and edit the file details to signify its platform is Mac (OS X) and set the release_notes for the file.

10. Repeat for Install-CalChart-$CCVER.exe.  Click on zip and edit the file details to signify its platform is Windows and set the release_notes for the file.

11. Update https://github.com/calband/calchart/releases

12. Have a cookie.
