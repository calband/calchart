How to release calchart:

The current calchart version is 3.5.2.  In all commands below, substitute that number for $CCVER (meaning when you read $CCVER, type 3.5.2)

0.1 Increment the versions in ccvers.h to CCVER

0.2 Modify the release version in the install script, build-win/CalChartInstallScript.iss.

0.3 Edit build-macos/CalChart.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, and change CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION to current version, $CCVER

0.4 Edit build-macos/dmg_maker.sh to have the right version

Because you sometimes run into build issues on one platform instead of another, do a build before you do a tag:
1. Prebuild the project to make sure its working
1.0.1: Make sure you note the git HASH you are dealing with.  Make sure both Windows and Mac are on the same hash.

---
For windows:

w1.1 Follow the instructions in README-win.txt

w1.1.1 Copy readme to build-win:
cp README.md build-win/README.txt

w1.2 Install InnoSetup
I use InnoSetup for creating the installer.  Get it from:
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

w1.3 CalChart is built having the C-runtime as a DLL.  Most users will not have the dll installed on their system.  We package up the redistribution installer with our package for them.
  w1.3.a. Find the file on your system:
     find /cygdrive/c/ -name "vcredist_x86.exe"
  w1.3.b. copy it to \calchart\build-win.

w1.4 Build the setup.exe installer:
Compile via Build->Compile.

w1.5 The installer is called setup.exe.  Rename to:
$ cd build-win/InstallerFiles
$ mv mysetup.exe Install-CalChart-$CCVER.exe

The final product is Install-CalChart-$CCVER.exe

---
For Mac:
m1.1 Follow the instructions in README-macos.txt

m1.2 Run dmg_maker.sh
$ bash dmg_maker.sh

The final product is CalChart-$CCVER.dmg

---

2. Tag the depot
$ git tag -a v3.5.2 -m "calchart-3.5.2”
$ git push origin v3.5.2

3. Go to a temporary directory on your system to recheck at the tag.  This is to avoid having any unwanted files
$ cd /tmp
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/calband/calchart.git calchart
$ cd calchart
$ git checkout v3.5.2

4. Rebuild the release now that you have the tag (repeat instructions for step 1)

5. Go to the sourceforge page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/calchart
You'll need to be logged in as Administrator to modify the files.

6. Go to Project Admin -> File Manager

7. Make a new directory for this version (click on the * next to root)

8. Upload the README.txt to the new folder.  Click on README.txt and edit the file details to signify it's a release notes.

9. Upload the CalChart-$CCVER.dmg to the folder.  Click on dmg and edit the file details to signify it's platform is Mac (OS X) and set the release_notes for the file.

10. Repeat for Install-CalChart-$CCVER.exe.  Click on zip and edit the file details to signify it's platform is Windows and set the release_notes for the file.

11. Have a cookie.
