<P>
Open an Animation window (under the Window pull-down menu) to view animation.
Use the icons to navigate through the show and the slider to set the tempo.
Click on the check-box labeled Collisions to enable detection of collisions.
If you make changes to the show, you can select Regenerate from the menu
to recalculate everything.  When errors are encountered while generating
the animation, a window will appear with the types of errors.  You can
click on an error to select the points that caused this error.<P>
There are many significant improvements over Version 2.  First of all,
there are no more animation files.  Everything is handled dynamically.
You can also select points and follow them in the animation window
(e.g. you can follow the percussion line.)<P>
