<P>
CalChart Version 3.5 is a update of of CalChart Version 3 (the version
that has been used by the Cal Band from 1991 to the 2008).  The major
improvements have been to port it to the MacOS X platform, integrating closer
with the native windowing system functionality like file history and printing.
It retains backward compatility with CalChart Version 3 files, though older
CalChart version are not supported.<P>
CalChart, like all software, may contain issues and bugs.  And like all 
software will greatly benefit from feedback from
users.  Please document any bugs that you encounter on the CalChart developer 
website at:<P>

Also, we would very much like to hear any suggestions you may have to make
CalChart even more useful.<P>
This chapter gives some hints on getting to know Version 3.5.  Much is
very similar to Version 3, and for users already familiar with Version 3 may 
not even notice a difference.<P>
