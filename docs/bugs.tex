\section{About Reporting Bugs}\label{reportingbugs}

Mail bug reports to gurk@calband.berkeley.edu.  Please try to include
helpful information to track down the bug.  Try to reproduce the bug,
and give me instructions on how to duplicate it, or include a show that
illustrates the problem.  Include the date from the About window so I
know what version you're using.  Comments or suggestions are also
appreciated and should be mailed to
calchart-discussion@calband.berkeley.edu.

\section{Known Problems}\label{problems}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0pt
\item Only prints to PostScript printers
\item Edits in continuity are not immediately registered
\item Documentation is sorely lacking
\item Redrawing is slow
\item Handling of points off the field (and in endzones) could be better
\item Define DOF between sheets
\item Sheet bar should be a scroll bar
\item Autosave doesn't use unique filenames or prompt to recover files
\item Arc drawing for Rotatemove is incorrect sometimes
\item Shearmove can't be specified as any direction
\item Zero vectors for Geniusmove aren't displayed
\item Order of move icons should be changed
\item Large values of beats don't work
\item Somehow points get set to multiple continuities (Dan's animation bug)
\item Edit printed continuity menu item should be moved
\item COUNTERMARCH (there are probably bugs)
\end{itemize}
