<P>
The interface is mouse-driven and windows-based.  Many features cause a new
windows to appear in addition to the main window displaying the stuntsheet.
The user may have as many windows open as desired at any one time.  It
is possible to have many windows of the same kind open simultaneously,
and it is possible to have different windows displaying different shows
simultaneously.<P>
To scroll the stuntsheet viewer, just move the mouse around the field
display area of the window while holding the control key; scrolling happens
automatically.<P>
Various operations can be performed by either clicking on an icon just
above the stuntsheet display area or by using a pull-down menu.  Some
features have keystroke commands also.<P>
Left-drag the cursor in the stuntsheet editor to select a set of points.
Once points are selected many features can be applied to them.
Use Shift-left-drag to add points to an already selected block.
Use Alt-left-drag to toggle a points selection.<P>
Use the Undo feature under the Edit pull-down menu to undo actions.
Repeating this causes older and older actions to be undone.  The user
can retrace his steps all the way back to the most recent save
(providing that the undo buffer, which defaults to 100 items, is big enough).<P>
Use the icons just above the stuntsheet display area to navigate through
the show.  Use the slider to adjust the magnification of the display.<P>
Window sizes can be adjusted by dragging the corner of the window
around.<P>
