# Printer Configuration

In general, there are two ways of printing, Native Printing, and Post-Script
Printing.  For windows, Native Printing may have sub-optimal results, so you
may want to do Post-Script printing.  With Post-Script printing CalChart can
print to PostScript printers (such as laser printers).  You can also  print
to a PostScript file and use ghostscript (a free PostScript interpreter) to
print to another printer.  On a mac, the post-script file can be viewed with Preview.
