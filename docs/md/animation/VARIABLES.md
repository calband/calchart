# VARIABLES

In order to aid in complex continuity, values can be stored in variables.
There are seven that may be used:

```
  A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z
```

There is no specific meaning to any variable, and each can be used for any
purpose.

To place a value in a variable, use an assignment statement; for example:

```
  A = 3
```

This places the value 3 in the variable `A`; it will remain there until it is
replaced or the execution of the continuity is completed.

To use a variable, simply use the name of the variable in place of a number.
