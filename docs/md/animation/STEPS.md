# STEPS

There are several ways to specify the number of beats to be used.  An
explicit integer may be specified, such as 8.

Any numerical function or variable may also be used (see those sections).

Additionally, the special symbol `REM`, which stands for remaining, always
contains the number of beats which remain to be used on the current
stuntsheet.  Thus, `REM` changes with every beat.
