# Basics

At the heart of CalChart is the field view.

To scroll the stuntsheet viewer, just move the mouse around the field
display area of the window while holding the left mouse button and the control key; scrolling happens
automatically.

To zoom in or out of the field view you can use the pinch gesture, the zoom controller, or the control-+ or control-- shortcut.

Use the Undo feature under the Edit pull-down menu to undo actions.
Repeating this causes older and older actions to be undone.  The user
can retrace his steps all the way back to the most recent save
(providing that the undo buffer, which defaults to 100 items, is big enough).

Various operations can be performed by either clicking on the toolbar icon just
above the stuntsheet display area or by using a pull-down menu.  Some
features have keystroke commands also.

Use the icons just above the stuntsheet display area to navigate through the show.
