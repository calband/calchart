# Move Points Into a Line

This movement command is used to move a block into a straight line.

First select the block of points you wish to have placed in a line.  Then
left-click the point where the first point in the line should start.  While
holding down the left-button, drag the mouse to where the second point in the
line should be.  Release the mouse button and CalChart will move all of the 
points into a straight line from that point.
