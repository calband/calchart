# Genius Move

This movement command is used to translate a block of points by describing the
general shape you wish the block to attend.

First select the block of points you wish to have moved.  Left-click and drag
3 lines that generally describe the shape you wish the block to take.
Release the mouse button and CalChart will check to see if it is a valid move,
and if so, will apply a genious move to the block.
