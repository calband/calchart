# Shear Block

This movement command is used to shear a block across around a point.

First select the block of points you wish to have sheared.  Left-click the 
pivot point where the block should be sheared around.  On the second left-click
a guiding line should appear.  The line must extented at a 90 degree angle 
from the start point to the pivot point.   While holding the left-button, drag
the line to the desired shearing amount.  Release the mouse button and CalChart
will shear the block around the pivot point by the desired amount.
