# Resize Block

This movement command is used to resize a block, to make it larger or smaller.

First select the block of points you wish to have resized.  Left-click the 
central point where the block should be resized around.  Left-click and
drag a resizing line.  Release the mouse button and CalChart
will resize the block around the central point by the desired amount.
