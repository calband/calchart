# Rotate Block

This movement command is used to move rotate a block around a point.

First select the block of points you wish to have rotated.  Left-click the 
pivot point where the block should be rotated around.  On the second left-click
a guiding circle should appear.  While holding the left-button, drag around
the circle to choose the desired angle.  Release the mouse button and CalChart
will rotate the block around the pivot point by the desired angle.
