# Creating a Show

Starting the program causes a small window to appear.  From the File pull-down
menu you may open an existing show via the "Open..." item (or the Alt-O hotkey),
or you may create a new show via the "New" item (or the Alt-N hotkey).  You may 
also choose from the list of files to quickly load a previous open filed.

Creating a new show will start the "New Show Setup Wizard", which is intended
to make creating your new show easier.  The wizard can be used to determine the
number of points, the kind of labels, and the kind of background.  You must
press finish to have the changes take effect, but you choose cancel and 
then modify any of these settings later on.
