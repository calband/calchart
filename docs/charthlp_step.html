<H3>STEP</H3>
<P>
Format: STEP(<TT>&lt;beats&gt;</TT> <TT>&lt;blocksize&gt;</TT> <TT>&lt;start point&gt;</TT>)<P>
STEP is used in conjunction with MT to implement step-drills,
where one person starts, and then some steps (say x) later the next leaves,
and x steps after that the next leaves, etc.  STEP returns the number of
counts for the given person to marktime in relation to the given start
point; however, it can be used for other things besides step-drills.<P>
The <TT>&lt;beats&gt;</TT> parameter specifies how many beats are to elapse between
people leaving, and the <TT>&lt;counts&gt;</TT> parameter specifies how far apart the
people are from each other.<P>
The <TT>&lt;start point&gt;</TT> is a point which is considered the beginning of
the drill (e.g. the first to leave).<P>
For example,
<PRE>
  MT STEP(2 4 R1) W
</PRE>
will make each person in a 4-step block leave 2 counts after his neighbor;
the first person to leave is at the same location as R1.  While they are
waiting to go, the people will marktime west.<P>
