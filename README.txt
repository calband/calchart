What is CalChart?
---

CalChart is the open source project created and maintained by members and
alumni of the California Marching Band.  We use the software to chart our 
marching shows.  This program allows us to plot how we want marchers to move,
and how formations to flow.  It is used to animate a show, and to print out
continuity (poop sheets).

CalChart makes use of several opensource projects.  It uses wxWidgets version
2.8.0.  Also, it uses bison, flex, and transfig projects, and also the tex2rtf
project that is part of wxWidgets.

Helping Develop CalChart:

Visit the CalChart sourceforge.net page.

SourceForge.net is the site that we host the source project for CalChart.
SourceForge.net is a server that host many open source projects, allowing people

calchart.

----
Reporting a bug.
----

I recommend signing up for a SourceForge account.  When you log bugs or feature
request to CalChart, it always helps to be logged in.  You *can* log your issues
as a guest, but it makes it very hard for the person fixing the bug to
communicate with you.

From the CalChart project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/calchart/),
click on Develop, then Tracker, then Bugs.  This should list all of the bugs
currently logged against CalChart.  Your bug may already be here.  If it is,
then add any information to the bug.  If it is there, and it has been fixed,
please reopen the bug and put more information on it.  Or click on "Add new" to
add a new bug.

This will bring up the new Bug page.  Please enter a summary and a description
of the bug.  If you have any reproduction steps that will cause this bug to
happen, please enter them.  The more details, the more likely it is to fix.  If
you have a file that causes this to happen, or if you have any screen shots of
the problem, attach them to the bug.

Requesting new features.
---

Sometimes what's wrong isn't a bug, but that there is a lack of a feature.  If
there is something that you wanted or something that you think will make
CalChart better, please create a Feature Request.

I recommend signing up for a SourceForge account.  When you log bugs or feature
request to CalChart, it always helps to be logged in.  You *can* log your issues
as a guest, but it makes it very hard for the person fixing the bug to

From the CalChart project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/calchart/),
click on Develop, then Tracker, then Feature Request.  This brings up all the
feature requests logged against CalChart.  You may see that somebody has already
entered the feature.  If so, please add your opinions to it.  If not, click on
"Add new" to add a new Feature Request.

This will bring up the new Feature Request page.  Please enter a summary and a
description of the Feature.  The more details, the more likely it is to be
implemented.
