How to release calchart:

0. Increment the version in ccvers.h

1. copy trunk to a tag:
$ svn copy -m "copying trunk to tag for version 3.1.4" https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/trunk https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/tags/calchart-3.1.4

2. get that tag on your computer
$ svn co https://calchart.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/calchart/tags/calchart-3.1.4 calchart-3.1.4

3. Build the product:
---
For windows:

w1. make calchart
$ make

w2. Put the project in a directory
$ mkdir CalChart-3.1.4
$ cp -r calchart runtime docs CalChart-3.1.4

w3. Compress the folder (I use compress, but make sure to fix up the extension).
$ mv CalChart-3.1.zip CalChart.3.1.4.zip

The final product is CalChart-3.1.4.zip

---
For Mac:
m1. pre-build so we have all the files we need:
$ export CXXFLAGS="-arch i386"
$ make
$ make html

$ cd build-macos
$ xcodebuild -configuration Debug

m3. Edit the dmg_maker.sh to have the right version

$ bash -f dmg_maker.sh

The final product is CalChart-3.1.4.dmg
