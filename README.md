# What is CalChart?

CalChart is the open source project created and maintained by members and
alumni of the California Marching Band.  We use the software to chart our 
marching shows.  This program allows us to plot how we want marchers to move,
and how formations to flow.  It is used to animate a show, and to print out
continuity (poop sheets).

Calchart uses several open source tools for building an executable for a target
system.  There are different UI windowing systems (like Cocoa for Mac, or GNOME
for linux, or QT for cross platform), but wxWidgets was chosen as a good
balance of features, cross-platform, and support.  This allows one version to
be built on Windows/MacOS/Linux, but also means that proprietary UI Kits like
iOS would be difficult to support, requiring a complete rewrite.  Currently,
Calchart uses wxWidgets version 3.1.

Calchart also has an internal compiling language for interpreting the
continuity commands into movement.  This language description is converted into
source code using bison and flex.  The Calchart documentation is done with a
group of tex files that are converted into HTML by some unsupported tools.  The
tex files can be re-edited and used to regenerate the documentation, but the
conversion tools are unsupported.  The generated HTML results are also
distributed in the developer package.


## Helping Develop CalChart:

Visit the CalChart GitHub page:

CalChart is hosted on github.com in the Calband/CalChart section.  You can
think of this as the "developer" site of CalChart.

https://github.com/calband/calchart

note:
The CalChart sourceforge.net will be used for hosting CalChart deliverables files, but
principle development will be on GitHub.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/calchart/

## Reporting a bug or requesting a new feature.

CalChart uses an issues page on the github site for tracking bugs and features.
To post issues, you will need to create a GitHub account at https://github.com.

From the CalChart project page (https://github.com/calband/calchart/),
click on Issues.  This should list all of the issues logged against CalChart.
Your bug may already be here.  If it is, then add any information to the bug.
If not, click on "New Issue" to add a new bug.

This will bring up the new Issue page.  Please enter a summary and a description
of the issue.  If you have any reproduction steps that will cause a bug to
happen, please enter them.  The more details, the more likely it is to fix.  If
you have a file that causes this to happen, or if you have any screen shots of
the problem, attach them to the bug.  If you are requesting a feature, add
anything that you think will help create the feature, such as describing the
desired behavior.


## Building CalChart

CalChart use CMake to help with making a central build system.

For building on MacOSX platforms, see the [README-MACOSX.md](README-MACOSX.md).  For building on
Windows platforms, see the [README-WINDOWS.md](README-WINDOWS.md).

If you need to regenerate the help documentation, see the [README-docs.txt](README-docs.txt).
